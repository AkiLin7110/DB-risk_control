It’s part of the new Spring eventWe use NcSimul at work. Pretty cool, you can simulate your G&M code file, prove it before sending it to the machines.And dad said all those video games were a waste of time!lol saw that. wanted to try itIt's pretty fun, not gonna lieWe use Vericut to simulate every program before we run it.What do crashes look like?In the late 1980's I wrote a software package that drew the toolpath on screen. We used it to 'prove' programs before we'd let the students run them on real CNC's. Saved a lot of crashes, bent tooling, mooshed spindle bearings, etc.It was quite simplistic compared to modern software though. It would run the CNC program & show the tool path in 3D from any viewpoint, but not the tooling, machine, chuck, etc. It had to run in DOS on an XT with 640K of RAM, so was quite limited.Looks like the new stuff is way nicer.What's the name of this?The interface tells me it's SunSpire stuff. You can either buy them on the pc for around 25 dollars USD, or a couple app versions for like 3-5 dollars. The site is sunspire.site They have quite a few other simulators and like 4 metal working simulators.cncsimulator.com is better imo, but also more expensive.The best simulators are 'contact us' pricing unfortunately.That's how I learned how to write code.Ok but does it actually make it crash if you push it too hard? Cuz otherwise whats the pointIt simulates COOLANT.Hey op do you have a link for the simulator shown in the video?I’m still learning cnc coding and this would probably help me immenselyHow’s the name of that Programm?engine stupendous lip wild vast slap lavish threatening plants boatThis post was mass deleted and anonymized with RedactI want a simulator advanced enough to simulate chip generation.no , never could figure it out , seems easier to just manually type the program and use sub programs if neededYup, it's the bomb. Once you get used to it it's very good. Made some very interesting parts with it.Old hardinge elite 8/51.Use it for bolt circles a lotNo, only the simulation.We ‘almost’ only use the dialog for lathe, it happens we need to use SolidCAM for advance stuff though :)I used similar on simens ui for really complicated profiles or if client gave us shitty blueprints (i didnt use pc cams for lathe). It cut down programming time because i could do both roughing/finishing cycles at same time, and ad them as subprogram. Only shitty part was that siemens didint post it own code as g-codes, it was something else, no one was able to read and edit it. so fine tunig had to be done it own editor, but it was easy.For complicated geometries, yes. For simple shit, no. It's another tool in the box, but it's a little cumbersome to use exclusively.That depends on how you program it.Who's letting you run a CNC without knowing what cutter comp is? This is totally their fault, not yours.Distance to go distance to go always check your distance to go!!!!Yes, if you're using cutter comp the machine needs to know the size of the cutter.Depends on if you are running cutter comp and part edge or centerline codeI have the luxury of using machines with tool setters built in, and I use them. For our other machines in the shop, we use a tool cataloging system that already has runout sorted, as well as all of our tool data and tool holder data sorted. Rather than signing out tools to employees who might work on different machines, we just sign them out to the machines. Everything is accessable by our phones and it makes all of the sorting much easier since we don't need PC's for all of our machines.Most people pronounce it Fanook but when you call Fanuc directly and they answer the phone they always say Fannik.I’ve always liked fan-uck, compromise between the two...‘Fannik’. Weird fkn names/pronunciation for all of them.It’s fannik but I still say mother fanuc-ersyou must have got a manual with the machine.I use it to engrave occasionally. The only pain with it is that the serial number won't incrementally increase by itself so I have to edit each one manuallyCheck youtube.comManual guide i?You have made any sub programs for every alphabets?. Damn Haas has made it so easy to engrave parts.Haas is just a Fanuc with bad mazatrol canned cycles.They (Haas) have a great YouTube channel with a lot of good information on basics and how to navigate their controls.Props to haas for actually having an up to date YouTube page with relevant tutorials and explanations.You can figure out everything you need to learn about a haas through their YouTube page.Haas does a “tip of the day series” that has a ton of useful info as wellHere is Haas’ programming workbook. It has gotten me out of many jams.You'll pick it up quicklyI found this video last night while trying to learn about mills myself. Hopefully it helps!!Change the input channel from 4 to 2. Make sure baud rate matches on both endsEthernet!It has one.https://www.fanucamerica.com/products/cnc/cnc-software/programming-simulation-software/program-transfer-toolIt only costs about $30And if you don't have a switch or hub, you can use a crossover cable and connect directly from machine to PC.You can set up folders for the machine to read from... Or dripfeed from.Or manage files from your desk. Literally drag and dropI have done it with an IT guy. We checked in manual what parameters needed to change, he made sure the IP adress of PC for the machine stayed stationary and made sure the network folder worked.Fanuc: Fucked(over) ANother Unsuspecting CustomerOut of curiosity, why would you want to go back to rs-232?Our rs network has always seemed a little buggy and the file transfer is significantly slower.Couldn't you use the network connection? Transfer stuff instantlyChange parameter from 0 to 1 I think on MDI. Then change channel using MDI from 4 to 1 I believe. Then change back parameter from 1 to 0 then press reset.Not sure what you need for settings for your pc to read the connection but I might be able to help on Monday if it's not solved stillSounds like a cutter comp issue. Check radius in tool table or disable G40If I recall correctly those controllers don't use work or tool offsetsYou'll also be pretty hard pressed to find folks with experience on anything that old. I would suggest getting the manuals and starting there and take it slow while you figure everything out.I'm sure there's thousands and thousands of dollars you can make with that machine once you have it mastered (or at least the basics down lol) and it should be easy to pick up similar machines for next to nothing if you want to scale upI'd like to know your opinions on this, reliability, ease of use etc. No I know you're not a Dinosaur just a well mannered senior citizenSearch fanuc 3T and you will wind some pdf manuals...Got that one with fanuc 3t. New screen is not retrofit. It is just PC with touth screen for uploading gcode to lathe. Ask me my lord, mayby I can help ;)Learned on a 5T. They're a different beastIgnore the "/". It's just there to get around reddit not liking G code./ #5223= Z value for new bar. (Resets G54 Z)/ #100=0. (Sets counter to 0.)/ N1/ ~TOOLPATH~/ #5223=[#5223-.65] (This line increments your G54 Z by -.65)/ #100=[#100+1.] (This line adds 1 part to your makeshift part counter)/ IF[#100LT12.]GOTO1 (This line sends you back to N1 if the number of parts machined is less than 12.)/ #100=0. (Once you have 12 parts, the program continues on to this line, and resets the makeshift counter to 0.)/ M30You can use a G10 line or play around with different variables to find out if you want to use #5223 to increment G54Z or not. You should also choose a variable that isn't being used for anything as your counter. #100 gets used by probes and tool eyes a lot, so you may need to find a different variable.I mean I think you can set the geometry for each tool to the first length, and then use G54 Z=0, G55 Z=-1*(part length+part off+facing stock), G56 Z=-2*(part length+part off+facing stock) etcThere should also be a Gcode (G10? Or something) that can be used to shift the offset every cycle as wellIf you skim one of the faces of all the blanks on a different work center first and hold them all to the same overall length, you can just set your initial G54 to the same spot every time. And let her eat with the first set up method. Depends on if you have a G50 type machine or a geometry page though.Hi guys, thanks all for your input. G52 is the easiest way for work shift. Works absolutely nice.use a main program that runs 12 times. at the end of your sub program do a Z zero shift the length of your part plus cut off plus facing. make sure to shift back the entire length at the end of the mainShare programUse a macro or just make a program for 12 parts.That's what "Edit" is for unless I'm misunderstanding this question.Is this a joke?Use shift key for parenthesesThe machine demands a blood sacrifice.The message is mostly cut off in your picture, but as a wild guess- if the machine got e-stopped, you have to hit the power button again on some machines after clearing the estop button.You need to do a blood sacrifice, it helps keep the machine tolerance. /sI apologize I mean the red oil symbol. Edit: centered up in the the photo next to the axis symbols.Apart from oil/grease level low, have had similar for low air pressure on some machines. If it's grease it could be an air lock (should be a bleeding nut under the grease unit) if it's oil check the pot for anything loose in there that could trigger the lube low switch. That's everything I've come across sorry if no help.We have a dvf5000 but it's heidenhain. I haven't touched a fanuc control in ages and don't miss it lmaoIs your way lube low?Yeah take interlock off the door and stick it straight into the mating part. Our interlocks are only on the door when Health and safety come around. We have two SMEC 2600 here.No, I dont think so on the smec. You may be able to bypass the interlock in maintenance mode, but the newer fanuc controls are pretty locked down when it comes to preventing someone from getting hurt.but I have to ask why you actually need this as a feature?Somewhere in the ladder. Where? No idea. Will Fanuc tell you? 99% chance not.Our smecs have an oi-tf plus control , and its keep relay 3.0 to bypass the door switches , then u can turn the key on the top of interlock to keep it unlocked forever, its like a lil triangle key , interlock looks correct but door is always unlockedThese older machines need to be further away from the zero positions before you zero return. There is a deceleration switch to count 1 rotation of the ball screws as you zero return. Last thing at night after M33, move all the axes approx 50mm away from zero and then zero return. Watch the axes slow down as they approach home.I reloaded the backup parameters and now it only shifts less than 1mm. Still imo it shouldn't move at all since this apparently has absolute pulse coders (it gives error message that says something like absolute pulse coder needs zeroed after reloading parameters, not normally showing that at startup)Sorry, went into milling mode there, you won't be using M33 at the end of a shift. The same principles apply though. Powering off too close to the zero return switch causes your issues. The machine doesn't have absolute pulse coders, so doesn't know where it is after power off, hence zero return. Move the axes away from zero at the end of the shift and zero return in the morning. You shouldn't get an over travel.Had the same issue with a Haas lathe. Encoder back up battery needed to be replaced. Not sure if a machine that age has an absolute encoder.Is there back lash in the ball screw you are working with?It should be but could dependant and the model and builder options. We have monitoring on out tornos with Fanuc control and a Doosan puma 2000y. Two other doosan lathes but no monitoring option on them.I only use the tool life monitor on Citizens for the cutoff toolI have used pcmia to CF adapters for a FANUC robot. Never had a problem, everything we plugged into it worked just fine.Watch the size of the flash card. Don't go over 1GB in size.You can use the laptop PCMCIA to Flash card adapter. It just sticks out of the control panel.The FANUC PCMCIA adapter allows the CF card to fit into the control, lock in place, and the little door to close.Use M198 to call programs off of the card.Must be Fanuc i series to work.I have a small VMC that uses PCMCIA cards.I'm not really sure what you're asking though. The controls memory doesn't have much to do with the device you plug into it.There should be a way to run DNC, directly off the card for larger programs. I've only ever done that a few times though, and not on my machine actually. DNC is kind of annoying and I usually just try to reduce the program size to avoid it.If you're programming in Mastercam, are you using the 'Arc Filter' Settings?If you get desperate, remove comments, spaces, line numbers, change your G00/G01/G02 to G0/G1/G2 etc.250K is enough to do some work. Hell, I have an old Mazak at work that only takes 40k.That's a new enough control model you should be able to get a CF (Compact flash) to PCMCIA Adaptor and use the CF card for bigger storage. I personally run a 512mb, and a 4Gb CF Card for my adaptor (some models won't recognize the card if it's too large, that's why i have the 512mb)It's only the super old model-18 era stuff that requires the actual PCMCIA card, with the internal battery etc. Those are very expensive and you don't need it unless you're dealing in those super old controls from the 80'sDon't overthink it. Dont listen to people talking about dataserver or fanuc PC program.1x pcmcia to cf card adaptor1x CF card. Sometimes they can be a bit picky, but they're so cheap just keep going until you find one that works.

Our machines are 2010 with crap memory. A way around this lack of memory is using a fanuc pc program that creates a special file on the cf card. You drag and drop your NC files on to that file.When the control sees that file, it sees the card as if it is internal memory.Google fanuc pc tool for memory card operation and editing. Check out practical machinist forumYou will need:The fanuc PC TOOL €20We needed a Fanuc option turned on in the control. Fanuc themselves might have to activate this. €600CF card and cf to pcmcia adapterWorth mentioning the r/retrocomputing crowd have adapters and emulators for stuff like this that lets you use modern stuff like SD cards or USB sticks on old machines.That's what they're for. Never heard them called that before.They are called “snippets” on the DMG-MORI I have the pleasure of having to deal with occasionally. I don’t use them though. I can usually just write it out faster than hunting through the “snippets” and making those work. But the more programs you have to write or fix yourself, the easier it will get. Copy and paste!I also have never heard them called this ( I am a machinist)Tried rounding down the feedrate? While programming, I never use decimals in feedrates.Had this issue on a lathe earlier, make sure you have an M3/M4 with your speedDoes Z-1.1 violate a soft stop?Why do you say you should drop out??Also, what does your position say you are at for program and machine coordinates at that positionCan you post picture of screen with machine position and active G and M codes?What was your previous x/y move before this line? If you are running cutter comp, the control could have some issues figuring the math. Have had this problem before with tight lead in and outs.OfsetNeat, didn't know FANUC had one, I'll have to study up on this!I use a Siemens trace function for process monitoring. But what it's really capable of depends on the creativity of the data consumer.I've seen this used to identify poor 5ax tool path (ie. unwanted axis reversals and inconsistent velocity).You can maintain a constant spindle load by driving your feedrate as a function of the parameter. Heidenhain has a version of this already.You can use historical data to drive whether or not your real-time process is going to produce a good part.As service guy I use it quite alot to find information. You can see where the position error is, how much. For instance a customer had a table on table machine with tool marks on specific moves. I showed the customer which axis is bouncing around. We adjusted preload, slightly better. Swapped encoder on/off, went away, change the encoder, issue solved.Waveform can also be used if you have the software to 3d map the tool path and use the servo data to see where the heavy cuts are and how out of position, torque is required, etc. You can adjust programs based on real data instead of running it through vericut to simulate it.Just my opinion it's not a one time use if you want to fully optimize your machine.You may not have the macro enabled on your control. It is an option. Fanuc can sell it to you. Macro B is $1,700.00 plus installation. I used to have a cheat sheet to enable macros in Fanuc O machines. I probably still have it somewhere. I'll see if I can find it. In the mean time, check out the macro section of my web app and let me know what you think: https://cncmachinistcalculatorultra.com/customMacroDepends on the machine builder, but probably it switches off the lights in the machine during production and after x amount of time that the machine has been standing still it powers down the drives. The machine manual should have an explanation about what it does exactlyI work with homag cnc routers and they have thus eco mode too. Strictly power saving when idleYeah, they can be used with G65.

I have done something similar with Haas machines, but I'm fairly certain it'll work on your Makinos. I don't know where it'll output that info -on my Haas machines it'd just output to a thumb drive- but I'm sure you could figure it out!I do this all the time to output inspection reports.Try this:POPENDPRNT[SAVEDVALUE1IS#500[34]]DPRNT[]DPRNT[SAVEDVALUE2IS#501[34]]PCLOSIt will save a DPRNT.txt file to you I/O channel.Edit: reddit screwed up the formatting.

Depending on your controller age.Make sure your io is set to 4 in the parameters. Honestly I prefer to get a flash card or flash thumb and just load programs manuallyWe use this thing called "smart cable". Should be first result on google.Laptop with a 9 port serial, or a USB to serial, plugs into it. Then it plugs into the 25 pin on the machine.Programs get sent with a program called terra term.Good luck with that one.It is not just a parameter toggle off, it's written into the ladder and protected.Both DN/Doosan and Hyundai removed any ability to toggle these off with the bit somewhere around 2016.Edit the ladder logic. It’s only realistic way to remove it.That'd be in the ladder and maybe the dcs. You ain't disabling that unless you edit those out.This is by design. It's written into the PLC, which you won't be able to edit.Good luck getting an ER on it, too.The good news is, newer door locks are using integrated RFID chips to prevent people like you from putting their coworkers in danger.Should just go to the next N12. I don't think FANUC supports directional goto statements. I've rarely felt the need to have multiple labels of the same number though. Not sure why you would do that.It will go to the next N12 in the program. Fanuc says N numbers should be unique in a program. It’s been a while but I think it searches down the program for the N number of your goto and then jumps to the beginning and searches to the current line. If you have repeated N numbers then the position in the program of the line calling the goto will change which line the goto jumps to, which is much more hazardous than having unique N numbers.You would need to change the ladderWhy would you set G54 in X? Usually 0 and then all your tools are set ?When I first learned I did it the same way you do then I learned how tool eyes work.I touch off all my tools in z from the chuck+.5. I just use a half inch end mill shank to touch off with.Why not touch everything off on the chuck itselfAfter rough turning, I touch off any other tools with a .25" gauge block, it doesn't save a whole lot of time though. I've been playing around with the idea of using my CNMG holder as a datum of sorts and working out the difference of my other common tools. Then once it is touched off, I could input that height and +input the difference rather than touch off the others.Also, unless I really have to, I keep my CNMG, VNMG, Top Notch and grooving/partoff holders in the turret at all times. Never touch the X values unless I'm changing to a 431 from a 432, then I'll put in a .01" X offset to be on the safe side. I've heard of people using the back plate as a Z reference but, never met anyone who stuck to it.I guess this is just a very long winded way of saying, I wish I had a better answer lol.I usually turned a known surface with T01 and set base tool offsets on that, and then touched off the rest with paper on the known surfaces.Tool changes could get pretty fast if you never swapped out T01 and tried to places tools so they would have almost the same offsets as T01.Can you move it at all? If not it probably tripped the e-stop and you just need to hit that "emergency alarm reset" button to free it up. If it can move it sounds like it just needs zero returned.Edit: if neither of those things work I found an incredibly detailed document from Doosan about fixing this error, this should help. One of the best things Doosan has going for it is how good the documentation online is, always start by just googling the error, you'll almost always find good reference material, even some youtube videos from Doosan.https://www.cnczone.com/forums/attachments/2/8/4/2/0/9/542748.attachThread depth should be subtracted from both sides to get het minor diameter. The 0.625 comes from 5/8To do the proper calculation: H=pitch * (sqrt(3)/2) Minor diameter = major diameter - 2 * 5/8 * HAre you using inserts that match the pitch of your thread? Or are you using general inserts that work for a wide range? If the latter, you will need to cut deeper than calculated because those inserts are sharp and need to cut below the true root of the thread where the minor diameter is measured.You will have to calculate the depth based on the "flat" in the root of the thread.One pitch is 75% of total depthI use .866 because it's the sine of the 30 degree angle and it's gets your straight depth. It's out of the machinist handbook. Also the machinist handbook will give you all those dimensions. If you don't have one you can download an old version off the Internet somewhereWhere's my G92 crew?Is your mdi like a blank programs page or two columnsYou likely need to turn on the hydraulics there should be a power on/startup/standby button all the fanuc machines I've used from different builders label it differently.You need to home the axis, Jog mode then zero return.After the above you'll be able to use MDI to change tool on mill just type in T(number) M06; insert, cycle startStart the controlStart any hydraulic unit(s)Go to reference, either automatic or in jog, jognit to the reference points (z-x-y usually in that order)Jog off these points and you should be able to do stuff in either MDI or manual, or load up a program on EDIT or run it with AUTOEdit: what kind of control is it? 0m, 0i, 31i, etc? Or in case of lathe 0t or something...Because on the older milling systems, they need this code in front:G91 G28 Z0T1M6G90So in MDI, G91 G28 Z0RunT1RunM6RunG90RunAlso, keep in check which coordinate system you're in.. G54 is standard...Also, make sure that your jog/rapid feedknob is NOT 0%, and that your spindle speed adjust is at 100%.. those got me the first couple times...Another edit:Mind you that in MDI you use the INPUT and not INSERT button... The latter is for editing inside a program....Another edit:Also, and I forgot this earlier, keep the machine at Z-ref point. This is on my machine the tool change position, but you can verify by checking the diagnostic/parameter list. I'm out camping at the moment, can't tell you which one they are, but you should contact the manufacturer (yam/yang in America has great support, ask for Andy) and get the electric diagrams and technical drawings, operator manual etc... Whatever you can.I run a MV-40 and SV-50 with Fanuc MSC 516 and 518. Put the machine in MDI mode, type your program, press insert. Keep the machine in MDI mode, press cycle start.On an MV-Jr you have to go into zero return, and press the axis jog key for each axis. There will be a light on the button that when it is homed out properly, it will be lit. Be aware, if your axis is close to the home position, you will need to press the jog button that is away from home and hold it, it will go in the opposite direction of home, and then return home, if the button is released in the middle of homing, it will have to be re-homed.Our two Kits have M90 as a warmup program.Some fanuc controls have a cold start as an m code, on my doosan it was like m112 or something.But cold start and warm up are not the same thingDid you release e stop, hit power on again and close and open the door?Sounds like the aicc2 setting have not been configured correctly. We had a similar issue with ours. Our service provider sorted it outJust put a G04 between the M08 and the next block to preload the coolant. It will take some trial and error. Arc feedrate is probably a parameter. Look in the Fanuc parameter manual. It would probably be a percentage of the program feedrate.G49 isn’t typically used on the same line as g05.1. - that is cancel tool length. Make sure aicc2 is flashing when running on the bottom of the control.None of my three do this, some parameter isn’t right. Make sure that there isn’t adaptive feed turned on.No clue on your blinking preference.Do you have the default coolant or upgraded? I have two machines with high pressure and one without. None take more than half a secondChip conveyor is annoying, this I’m pretty sure can be changed just never cares enough.This is almost definitely a battery-on-board issue. Battery died and all the parameters were lost.That, or it's a cabling or board failure.If turning off and back on again doesn't fix it, and if you aren't technically inclined, call a reputable cnc service company and get on the list... It'll be expensive, but it's the only good option.Does this machine have 4x D LR20 batteries?I can't remember the alarm exactly, but whenever we get an APC alarm it's 8/10 those 4 batteries that are on the outside of the cabinet door.1/10 times it has been someone accidentally pressing the emergency stop on the barfeeder.But why is parameter write enabled?Look in cabinet for little yellow fanuc battery they use those before the 4d cell setup.That’s weird I’ve never seen a fanuc run with parameter write enabled.Direct from the Fanuc 0i-F Maintenance manual: Since the absolute-position detector caused a communication error, the correct machine position could not be obtained. The absolute-position detector, cable or SEPARATE DETECTOR INTERFACE UNIT is thought to be defective.My thoughts: Since you are getting this on more than one axis, check the separate detector unit for power. This is assuming that the machine has more than just the motor encoders. It will be in the electrical cabinet, small yellow box with multiple encoder cables plugged into it.My company does customs macros, including Fanuc and Tosnuc (T600m~T999).Drop me a line at planterary-engineering.net if you need help.The key presses are awkward and unintuitive,Yup it's a Fanuc.I'm working with a 0T still .. isn't the 21T an upgraded version? It's pretty easy, but then again everything is when you've known it for a while . Do you have something like discord or something? Because I can walk with you if you like? If you're in the Netherlands or within reasonable distance i can drive over even..Not sure if it helps, but a quick Google search on how to set the work shift on a Fanuc 21t turns up some helpful sites.Show pictures of the tool geometry offset screen and the workshift screen.It's probably going to be 90% 3+2 programming. what software is it? mastercam?If the probe is run with OKK macros, the system is called T0-II software. Or if you're lucky someone added Renishaws Inspection plus.I still have a copy of the T0-II software manual.5-Axis Fanuc is either tilted work plane or TCP.Tilted work plane (G68.2) is based on Eulerian angle.TCP is G43.4I don't program OKK but I program mcam 5 axis for Fanuc's newest 31i.Depending on how the company you're going to operates there are a handful of ways the post will manage offsetting and executing g43.4.What I do is set up a template based on a work offset, based off the top WCS as my picked up work offset. So top is the top of stock and that is g54, in that template I also have g59 saved as the face of the pallet the workholding rests on. I use g59 to rough in all my probing positions.All 3+2 will be programmed using top as WCS and c and t planes as your tool axis plane. This shouldn't change for an OKK, with a Fanuc or Mitsubishi controller.For TCP, you will be doing all the work in top, WCS, tool and c planes. Unified is really really good. I generally use it as either to point, to chain or 3 axis with a named plane if I don't need the 5 axis motion. 5 axis can become an absolute mess drawing vectors and chains to follow so I recommend getting very good at organizing your levels manager, commenting what level stuff is driven from in the toolpath manager.Get a Postability post and call it goodI wanna get away from setting G54 zero off the top of the part.DMG Mori application engineers will tell you not to zero off of the top of the part. and to zero off the fixture instead. If the material is inconsistent that’s a material problem and not a problem with your program. Add a few passes to account for variations in material.I’m pretty sure the idea of G54.4 is so you can set G54 off the fixture and then just probe the material to make any minor adjustments. Kind of like what you’re doing with G54 / G59.Fanuc will do it for a couple of grand. Bastards.There's a few cheat sheets floating around out there that have the parameters sometimes those controllers have the option to unlock more memory with just a bit change. We had a tungtia topper vmc that I was able to double the memory on with just a bit change.Might look into getting the Fanuc Memory Tool. Look it up on YouTube. We use it on some of our robodrills, it allows us to store and run much larger programs then what the Fanuc control will hold.Those left covers look like a flash card slot. You can dnc from the flash at almost the same speed as on board. Compact flash card is way cheaper and more memory than a new fanuc board.Sinha’s Computer Aided Manufacturing, CNC Lathe, Probing and FMS. Get it on Amazon.Have your purchasing dept order "B-63947EN/01" from Fanuc, and use it like your bible. Parameters, variables, common g/m codes, alarms are all in there. We ordered ours from fanuc Japan because they were half the price of fanuc America, but they took 3 months to get here.One of the most annoying things with Fanuc is that very few things are set in stone, and MTBs can do nearly whatever they want. For example, one builder I work with uses the data table for all of their machine options (no keep relays), and another uses the data table only for the tool table and keep relays for machine options. Everyone is different. The best advice I can give you is to beg borrow or steal the machine manuals for a week and copy them to your laptop. Once you have a list of the keep relays, alarms, and the ladder password you can save yourself hours of frustrated troubleshooting by searching through the ladder. Googling the answer is something that you will have to do every now and again no matter what, though. https://imgur.com/GDttdYe.jpgDon't know if it pertains to my question or not, but our FANUC are old and new. We have 16i, 18i, 30i, and 0i-md. I think theres probably more I havent seen yet.Don't worry about the Haas. They are basically fanuc for dummies.Mazak is different; you won't instantly figure it out without some guidance. Not complicated, but not generic like a haas.Mazaks are not very user friendly in my opinion. That being said there is no reason an experienced person couldn't mostly learn them in a couple days. Might need a couple things pointed out to them.I'm a fan of Mazak controls.Haas are super user friendly. A person could probably self teach Haas control in a day.We only have HAAS in our shop.My coworker never worked on a HAAS before when he was hired here, and even he could figure out the controller.His first few weeks he was a little slow and had to take extra time to hunt down buttons, but it didn’t take him long at all.It really shouldn’t matter.In my experience, it shouldn't matter if you show interest in wanting to learn them and following through with it. I run a 7-axis Haas and a 5-axis Mazak (both lathes) with no real training at all. The Mazak I find to be great for simple turning operations, but some of the more complex features with live tooling I end up writing out in G-Code instead.In short, I'd say it probably comes down to the shop and what they're looking for. They may have had someone quit or retire without warning and they need to fill that spot, so training may not be an option. But I'd say if they put in some patience, a well rounded machinist should be able to do figure out the basics on their own with or without a brief run-down.It was a short notice deal, guy never came back from vacation. But again it was a Haas, idk.Some signs say the guy might not have been worth working for in long run. But damn that pay would've been nice.It literally doesn't matter what machine or cam software you use. Some machines and controls are better than others and same goes for software but at the end of the day all that matters is you can make parts in tolerance.I got snubbed hard in my job search because I don't know mastercam. Oh well, I see the same place (small 3 man shop) with job postings going up every few months for almost 2 years now. They missed out on me because I didn't know mastercam and looks like it really did them well. On the other hand, I found a shop that taught me enough to be making parts in Mastercam within my first day.If you can run a calculator, you can figure out how to operate a machine. Programming, diagnostics are an entirely different can of worms, which can be wildly different based on brand.Tl:dr; brand specfic requirements are retarded. A good machinist doesn't care what fancy name is on his control. A service guy cares a little.Going off memory so may be wrong, but I believe you have to set the IO channel to 4 to run programs off the card with M198.Make sure the USB drive is good (ran into that problem before)Open the controller and see if there is essentially a USB extension cable going from a board to the outside of the controller. Sometimes these cables go bad over time (couldn't tell you why). If you have room try to plug the USB right into the board or purchase a new USB extension cable. You can get them on Amazon for a few bucks, just make sure it will do power and data.Depending on how old the controller is, you need to set a particular IO channel to tell the control that you want to use a USB. Doosan/DN has a video on YouTube about setting the IO channel.Make sure your subprograms are in the same folder as your main program. I had to deal with that problem a week ago.I hope this helps!I would not run programs off a USB, they tend to get corrupted and the FANUC will read the gibberish code and crash. Ask me how I know.You have to set the machine I/O to USB. I have a MAPPSIV control so it's probably different than yours so I can't really give you directions on where to do this.We used network to DNC programs for a while, before we figured out how to set up the data server in the machine correctly and just use that now.Just to make sure, you're trying to plug in a USB drive with programs on it? It might need to be formatted with an old format like FAT32.I would recommend just connecting with ethernet.On the machine, check your settings and make sure that the I/O device is set to the USB. This is under Settings and option 64 IIRC. For the USB, make sure the program you are calling with the M198 is named Onnnn and nothing else. For example, if you are calling subroutine 10 using M198 P10, the file on the USB needs to be named O0010. with leading zeros and no file extension.You might have better luck using the high memory area on the machine, if you have the option. You can get to that area by pushing DNC or TAPE and setting the I/O on Settings Option 64. HMA is more reliable than USB in general.I have two possibly silly questions.Have you tried just using M98 instead of the M198?Are you sure the USB is fully engaged? I've had this issue with the Celos control a lot. The pocket where the port is located is too thin to get good contact with the port often. I had to eventually go to super slim USB drives to get around this.I thought m198 was to pull programs from a data server Also if your usb is too fast it might not work. I have "slower" usb that work fine in machines that are formatted the same as my fast ones. Fast one doesn't work on some controllers.You need to make sure your parameters 20-23 are 17I think it needs to be fat16 which would be fat on the computer. No idea why it's not working.I think it needs to be a smaller size than 128GB.Someone told me that this happens to non fanuc cards. There are a few brands that will work but not every brand will. I found what I'm looking for online but the bad thing is I want to just go pick it up in store somewhere close to me😐https://cnc-specialty-store.com/flash-sram-cards/compact-flash-card-256mbSomething like this apparentlyOnly some brands work, and even then only some sizes, we use Transcend brand 2GB cards at work (the 4GB will not work), they work fairly well, sometimes if you just unplug it from the PC without ejecting it seems to create an issue and needs to formatted, idk what kind of format, just right click on the drive name and then click format seems to work fine for me.Call fanuc and buy the kit its like 60 bucks. 2gb card and the needed cf adapter. Fyi if memory serves the doosan control has to be in tape mode to run off the card, and/or you have to call the program via an external sub call M198.Check if the PCMCIA port doesn't have damage on the connector pins.It's almost the same, just a little... dumber? It's Mitsubishi behind the control instead of Fanuc, and Meldas is almost the same but the one that got me a couple times was IF [condition] THEN variable = value isn't supported. That may have changed by now, but I wouldn't count on it. Using GOTO for simple conditional variable assignment is cumbersome after you're used to the better way with Fanuc, lol.There is a really interesting thing on Mazak that you might be interested in, which is basically conversational Mazatrol using G codes. Your best resource for that is the manuals that came with it.Best source of information is the manuels if you have them.  You can buy macros ready made from Mazak, they are not that expensive.   Macro programming is pretty much the same as fanuc, so get a copy of the fanuc macro book from Peter Smid    Company I work for bought the macro for 4th axis rotation calculations (640M and matrix control)  It just runs from an manual unit and is easy to use.   I can share an excel sheet that does the 4th rotation calculations if you want it? I haven’t tried every control in the world, but going from a Heidi control from the last two decades to anything else is going to be a step in the wrong direction for people who like to do things simple and easyFanuc is an old archaic as fuck system that should've morphed into something better or died out long ago.That being said, yes programming fanuc at the control absolutely sucks and is not very user friendly. Better to do it on a workstation computer instead.My experience with both is limited to my education, but i think it’s not gonna be a nice transition for you. Keep a list of all the m-codes to remember what does what.Never heard of Fanuc i4.Had to look the alarm up.An illegal G code is specified. This alarm also occurs if a G code corresponding to a non-additional option was specified.Which begs the question, does it even have that cycle?A G81 spot drill isn't a big deal, the canned cycle is probably more trouble than its worth anyway, Just G1 Z-.07 F13. and you're out of there. Peck drilling might be more problematic. I don't know Fusion, but Mastercam has an option to post code long hand. I start by looking for something like that.EditMight want to make sure that feed rate is right. I feel like a lathe is going to default to feed/rev, 13" a rev will be exciting.Does your lathe even have a canned drilling cycle?I have a machine with this exact control in my shop. I learned on it.You cannot use canned drilling cycles, also this machine will not tap. Hell you can't even use workshifts. You're better off using G01 for the spot, and for drilling we made a custom macro program with peck depth and retract amounts because we are a production shop but if its just a one-off you can just hand code your pecks and rapid ins/outs. Cumbersome but not that bad.Remove x from this block and put it in next block.Late to the party, but here it goes:Have you used peck canned cycles on this machine before? Some old machines didn't have the option for them.Your program has a line with G99 G18, G99 tells the machine your feed is programmed at Inches per Rev.Try replacing the G99 to G98 (IPM) and add a G99 at the line down the bottom with the G80, since you will want to go back to IPR for the rest of your program.Another option is replacing your feed (F13.3 IPM) to the equivalent in IPR= 13.3 IPM ÷ 1500 RPM = .0088 IPR.I would start by trying op #2 a chance first, since it's easier for manual editing at the machine.Try replacing your g81 with this ( N114 G83 Z-.0687 Q.19 F13.3 ) it would also be advisable to replace your g99 with a g98 on line 108 or change your feed to IPR .You are using G99 which is feed per revolution and your machine cannot do 13.3 inches per revolution. Convert that feed to IPR which comes close to .009 IPR which in my opinion is way to fast. I would do .004 feed.And use G83, not G81 for the peck drilling cycle.I’d download a pdf of the programming manual for it. It will tell you exactly what it can and can’t do. Keep in mind there are single and two line formats for Fanuc canned cycles. If your machine can’t do canned drill cycles then ya, macro is the answer.Maybe a part counter?Un locking the door?M30 at the end?What error code? Could be just a typo at the end of your programM30 to finish cycle and rewindSo it's a straight line, got it.If anyone is curiousIt's 0.7mm from a straight line at the furthest pointThis is a legend, so I can't swear to any factual basis, but....I was told of a farm machinery manufacturer that patented a seed distribution system that used air blowing against a 'flat' plate. A competitor specified a plate that had a curvature that was roughly that of Earth's surface to avoid the patent.I wonder if something like that is actually happening here.Had to mill it. Initial idea was G18 G03 but had to cut it and do it with segments of 50mm and G01.Excuse my ignorance, but what unit is the radius in?Erm boss, we're going to to need a bigger rotary table.;-)Uhhhhh,Metrology tools have a rate of error proportional ‘usually’ to Mpe+L/#Also, these tools have an exponential increase in that error rate for partial circular arcs, as the arc degrees approach a range of around 45 degreesThis is something to test with a custom made go-no-go imoMost importantly, clean your monitor.Asshole move to make that a radius and not a parametric functionIm pretty sure fanuc wants this red angle. Fanuc be weird like that. If you use manual guide i think it uses these angles to calculate toolpaths.update: it's indeed supposed to be 142 degAnother vote for Heidenhain. We have a shop full of them. Could never go back to FANUC!Heiden fan boy here.Heidenhain IMHO the best control made. They are actually the old Phillips control. Heidenhain bought Phillips in the 90's if my memory serves me. Siemens is my least favorite control.Heidenhain but I’ve only ran heidenhain, on a mill with universal head so the rotational ability of it makes things so simple. Siemens on a 3+c lathe and it’s certainly got its quirks. Might just be how it’s setup but I find the Siemens rather limited from a conversational standpoint with the milling. The heidenhain is easy to make it do whatever the fuck you want but the Siemens is still newish so still a lot of learning to doI've only ever used Heidenhain and love it! Easy and quick to program.We have a Siemens in a shop full of fanuc, it’s weird… Only one guy knows how to run it and it took a few months to figure out.I hate all things fanuc with a fiery passion. I use heidenhain TNC640 and i absolutely love it to death. We had another machine with a Siemens 840 that i fooled around with and it didn't really tickle my fancy, but i do believe it is a solid choice. I would choose heidenhain over all the rest.Fanuc.For me, the heidenhien control isn't worth it. On a 4 axis capable Doosan it's a 20k option, and the service is significantly more expensive.If a Fanuc machine doesn't come up in the morning, I know it's not going to cost more than 5k to get it fixed.Fanuc service is expensive, but next level. You call them up, tell them you want the full beans. The next day, a pallet turns up with every component in your machine. The day after, a tech turns up, and unless it's a motor or a MTB part, your machine WILL be running.And it'll be that way for the next 15 years. If you can tell me that's true of siemens or heidenhein, I'll eat my hat.Don't worry it's not a big deal. It will only cost 15k for Fanuc to come in and replace the controller.Just kidding.It looks like a power supply issue or one of your legs is low/high voltage.The control itself is not probably at fault, it's just detecting an issue with a power infeed module, a servo amplifier or spindle amplifier. I'd start by opening the cabinet and looking for lit alarm LEDs on the drive modules and the accompanying error codes on the little 7 segment displays. I'd also look for dark modules (with no indicator lights lit at all), which would likely indicate a missing auxiliary power supply to the module.I had that exact same alarm when some abraded cables finally shorted out.UPDATE: GOT BACK TO PROGRAM MENU AND ITS READING SV038 (A) SERIAL DATA ERRORNot a very good lathe guy. That’s some odd code though. Programming it through the control somehow?Do you have your Z origin set correctly?So before maintenance I have worked predominantly on a couple of OKK 800's (horizontal mill). Now over that last 1.5 years I have gained a ton of experience on three phase motors/servos, drives, power supplies, controls, inputs/outputs. Basically anything between the CNC and the inputs. Use multi meter on daily basis. No challenge with hydraulics. Can read electrical and mechanical prints (need to brush up). Have done everything to replace spindles and ball screws to correcting a grid shift. I dont know if any of this will help, as its just me typing thoughts as they come to me, but i was just hoping someone out there could point me in the right direction.The fanuc guys that come out to where I work tend to be wearing polo shirts if not just a logo company shirt. Their pants tended to be some short of khaki colored work pants.The job may require some knowledge of PLC interfacing with the Fanuc controls.I think on a job interview you wear a suit and tie. Yes on the job they wear khaki's and polo's but that would not be appropriate for the interview. It sounds like you have a good background for the job with the skills you have listed. I think a knowledge of Fanuc controls, parameter structure, setting up of servo motors would be helpful as wellIt couldn't hurt to watch as many youtube videos you can find for robot repair (if you can find them), familiarize yourself with their range of models, Google harmonic drives, and learn some terminology. I've worked with a few techs from Fanuc. Their skill levels...uhhh...vary. I'd say your experience would be more than adequate.I know you can run program from flash but I do not do it. Can’t remember.I would also like to know how, there is only one company I know that does this(Tornos). It is possible. Check out titans Swiss academy. Also would like to know this…There is a key stroke history in all newer Fanuc controls but it only tracks so many then drops them off. If I remember it's only 3 pages of key strokes. In my experience if you don't look at the history right away it will be gone. It depends how the machine builder sets it up but the Geometry offsets may be locked out by the memory input key. That's the way our swiss machines are.Not on any machine I've personally ran. However there should be a way to lock it out. Should be an edit key on your controller that you can take out. I've never actually used these as I dont run production unsure if it locks tool wear offsets as well or just geo.In my experience you buddy made a bad offset and is now lieing about it.To prevent future issues best advice I can give is use your smart phone and take pictures of your geo screen so you always have something to reference. This is honestly a great tip for any kind of work. Easy to delete geo accidently and if you have a picture can save yourself some trouble.You need to turn on exact stop check mode G61.G112/G113 may help you as well.It sounds like something to do with the Fanuc control on the DN not having a good enough look-ahead to parse the small lines of code quickly enough and keep a smooth contour.My lathe is a 0T control. I know old as shit.I just have to manually type the offset values into the offset number I want.I use a double sided boring bar in tool 3. So I touch off the boring side and manually type it in T13. Then touch off the turning side and leave it as T03On my doosan lathe there's a button combination:Feed hold + ignore error (i think it's called the blue one at any rate) + spndle stop.After pressing those you can skip around in the offset tableFanuc controller?Wait. Haas guy here. Wtf is T0120?T0120 = Turret position 01 + Offset number 20This is a thing on haas as well. Most commonly for sub spindle lathes to define the sub facing tools. I also use the additional offsets for the boring bar holders that have two pockets in the same turret position just out in x.I had similar issues but the easy fix was to go to parameter 5005 and change the QNI to 0.this gives you full access to set any offset using the Q-setter regardless of turret positionso you can have a tool in turret position 01 and set it to offset 20 using the q-setterI'll be giving this a go in the morning. Thank you!We have a laser tool setter on our YCMs. We just type in the tool number into the macro we use (g100 tN). We go up to 400. Fanuc control as well. In theory, all you'd need to do is just change the tool number in the code, buuuut the offset should be the other offset (t01100)You take offset t0120Add offset values to it. When you run program or simulation you use the t120 in first placement g code.G0 x500 z50 t120.And only reason to change those off set values are either your taking chip for measure. Or radius of insert changes.Not exactly what you're asking for, but I think there's some 4-digit g-codes to define the tool data in the program.You don't. The built in setup only does 1-12, or 1-24 if you have half stations.You would just manually type in the offset for any other tool positions. There are other ways to do it but they require a bit of macro work.I've been wondering about how to do that as well. I made myself a macro program for that yesterday where I put in what tool to copy FROM and to copy TO. Hit start after that and Z,X,Y and R values are copied over. If you want I can perhaps help you dabble into that sort of programming.What I need help for is when I have a double boring bar holder, (double barrel shotgun type) and want to probe the tools, I need to move the Y-axis to make the tools hit the q setter, but it will not allow Y axis to be out of reference. What to do?CheersBecause it is an old windows PC.Not familiar with DN/Doosan’s but they are likely overlaying the FANUC UI through FOCAS which is your comm link. Your FANUC is running like normal, it the PC struggling, which could be a variety of issues in it of itself.We have an early Pro6 Makino that is hellishly slow to do anything at times, but it runs HSM code no problem.I would recommend contacting your local DN Solutions (formerly Doosan) dealer/service provider and ask them about a software update.Not sure why nobody has set it yet, but why are you doing anything setup related at 100% rapid. You asked for trouble and you got itYou commanded a tool change for a tool that has no known tool length offset and then activated that unknown tool offset with G43 H6.Don't ever activate a tool offset if you are not sure that the tool hasn't been touched off yet. No wonder the machine took a nose down straight towards the table.Why are you bothering with tool comp calls while your trying to change tools?My guess is that you type in the code, left the line active on G43 H6. It reads that code to activate offset for that and with whatever you have in the offset, it rams right into the table.I never do a G43 after tool change to check a new tool, idk why you did nor do I know if it actualy cause the tool to runs to Z0 without commanding Z0 behind the H, but its a guessAre you sending the tool to a clearance position before making the tool change?Maybe missing g28?100% the value in H6 isn’t the correct length for that toolAlways handle jog z up several inches before changing tools after touch off with probe. I have bought a probe or two.Are you perhaps using the wrong work offset? We use z axial dials on g58 to set lengths of our tools.What machine and probe are we talking about? What's the max number of tools on the machine(pockets) and the control?A quick Google search says it's a pro 5. Never heard of that model though.Maybe pulling the back panel on the control (if possible) and getting some numbers on parts could help. I’ve talked on the phone before with FANUC in New York. They’re really easy to work with and really know their stuff.Fuck, I love this console. Every function available without 1000 sub menus. Lol.I would really like to see the rest of this vehicle.. please help me.Goddamn, what car is it?FanucarTape reader's in the trunk..Cool, more shit posting.....Do you have all the tool geometry in ? Tool nose radius etc ? Send me a DM I have a pdfAny success? I'm trying to use conversational programming on a doosan fanuc I series controller and get the same error. This is for turning an id.Do you have to set a length for your boring bar in the tool data? Seems like there is an error checking element tripping you up.Show us the programIs it possible to code throwbacks in FANUC code? Not like, rolling code lines. But I’d love to quit editing programs within the body of them.Like… at the top of the programN4 = T0606And instead of needing To update your lower code for your new setup, it’s justG0 N4???Why not use a sub?Hey I run C machines at my job! 100's and 200's, they're awesome machines.https://www.emastercam.com/forums/topic/74835-force-h-and-d-to-equal-t-at-the-machine-fanuc-31i/Googled "fanuc tool height offset match parameter" if that page doesn't have the answer scroll some more...Idk but I have a Fanuc USB that came with one of our Doosan and it has all the manuals on it. When I get back to work on Monday I can see if I can upload it somewhere if no one else can help sooner.Find the books that came with it. Fanuc still ships a cd rom with the controls.Find fanuc program folder and search for *.chm files and copy them to flash drive. You can open them in another pc without any additional software. I extracted manuals from FAGOR CNC this wayhave you tried turning it off and back on again? i’m not trying to bust your balls but I run a Fanuc series 160-m and more times then not i’ll just shut the whole machine off and give it 5 minutes before I cut it back on then it’s fineBad board maybe?Just hit “reset”. Reset fixes all.I'm only familiar with the robots from fanuc, so sorry if i am wrong but by your description it sounds similiar to a Battery Zero Alarm (BZAL-Alarm). Is there a option that is a bit "hidden" like a RES_PCA on the robots?I had a similar alarm and it required a reference return to zero the axis. Basically changed the axis feed back from the scale to the motor encoder. Jogged to the machine zero point. Switch back to scale mode and re reference. Cycle power afterI'm not familiar with cnc or digital machine controls but that usually means the file or folder name is longer than can be displayed. I just recalled MS-DOS does something like that for long file names.The symbol is called the tilde on a standard qwerty keyboard. It means "approximately" or "around". In this context, it means that the file name is longer than the operating system can display so it's truncated and replaced with the tilde.File name is too long. Depending on your control version you won't be able to load it unless you shorten it up.Just like everyone else has said, your file name is too long. That’s all! Usually won’t let you load it when it’s like that. Needs to be short enough that you can see .nc at the endThank you everyone for the information. Took me forever yesterday through trial and error to get a program in the control, and I'm glad I have some clarification.Not sure if hidden files or temporary files created when you open some program, it is where the data goes before you hit save, usually deleted when you close the program but if the computer crash, it will just stay thereRFM babyHey I saw that a few hours ago! Very impressive!We use a lot of smaller Fanuc Robots at the company I work at. I wish we used the larger ones more often!I saw this guy's bigger brother at their training center in Michigan a few months ago. Def looks larger irl.The one in Detroit has a Corvette that it liftsThey had a bright yellow corvette last one. Super cool robotsNext generation of Repo-MenThe guys at Lizard Lick Towing would die for this setupSingle Block it (to avoid look ahead) to whatever line you want to stop.Edit > N10 > Down Arrow (or the search softkey) > Memory (or Auto I guess) > Cycle Start.I don't know if I've ever searched in Auto.The down button isn't search anymore on the newer controls. There should be a soft key that says searchCan you do it in edit? N10 down arrow (I think) it's been a long time since I've delt with Fanuc.Even when you are looking at the program itself from auto, try clicking the soft key called “program” and try it from thereBoth are excellent. I would go fanuc just for the 100% fanuc control, if i was getting 5ax id go brother for the mx series.The shop I work for has a couple Robodrills and they’ve been very reliableBrother is one reliable mf, had a tc2 since 2004 running 40 hours per week and had never had single error or fault on anything dispite none existent maintainance.As others have said both are great. We have 10 Brothers now, mostly R450 and R650 pallet changers. For high production they are simply amazing. Spindle only stops for 3-6sec for the pallet change. The previous shop I ran had 25+ Brothers. Some were 15 year old machines that ran 20hrs a day x 6 days a week and rarely needed anything but coolant and grease.Fanuc. bought ours from Methods so fairly local support.We have a Speedio where I work and it is fast but personally I can’t stand it. I can put an indicator on the spindle and push it with my hand and move it .003. The rigidity is trash and the machine is less than a year old for context. Plus their control is proprietary and very annoying similar to an old Mitsubishi.I gotta ask are robodrills (just cnc mills as far as I can tell?) common in America? The only reason I knew about it was because of their Roboguide cam software for their robotic arms Edit:UK based here+1 for Fanuc as long as you keep the way covers clear and don't let the chips pile up to the table.You don’t want a W in your first G73 line, that’s your depth of cut and retract amount. You’re telling it one too many axes and I think W is the culprit - but I could be mistaken and it’s the U that’s the culprit! LolEdit - and you want to add a G01 somewhere in that code or it’s gonna try to rapid through it all. I usually have my first canned line as a rapid so it rapids to each depth faster but the safest is to put a G01 at the first line and let it go a little slower on the in rapids in betweenI don't have edgecam but in mastercam you can just select the type of tool nose radius comp you want to use. Normally we just hardcode the TNR into the toolpath on lathes instead of using G41/G42. If you don't use the same tool radius that it's programmed for, the part will come out wrong so you'd have to repost code if you want to use a different tnr. As it is, you've done just that and the radius you've programmed for is 0 radius (aka sharp corner)If you're writing this by hand, you'd just changeN15 G0 X-1.6 Z0.N25 G3 X40. Z-20.8 R20.8G73 would be if your raw material is already close to the right shape to cut down on air cutting. If you're using hex bar, G71 would be better. You said you tried G71 going from back to front with G2, but that cutting direction would be for facing with G72. You got an alarm so did you post that with edgecam or just change it at the machine?I'd do something likeG0 X50. Z25.G0 Z2.G71 U1. R1.G71 P15 Q25 U.4 W.1 F.2N15 G0 X-1.6G1 Z0.G3 X40. Z-20.8 R20.8N25 G1 X50.You could use USB or memory card and call the program directly from the card with M198. I don't bother with RS232 or ethernet.Some machines have separate DNC functions using Tape mode.Can you send programs from machine to computer?What problems are you having?I used a “shop floor automations” box to plug a usb in that then that allows u to set baud/etc. then yeahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOL9cMrD45w shows cimco edit and a usb -> parallel cord. that's a mori control so it's more like a fanuc 18 but I believe pretty similar. I believe you can also stream via the 'tape' mode on the machine and cimco edit will work with it.Sounds like you did a find/replace, and replaced all the G92's with N18. You might be able to fix it by doing the reverse, find all N18 and replace with G92, then manually change the line that's supposed to be N18 with N18.It sounds like you might not be familiar enough with programming or the machine to be messing with the program though.31i control means the machine is probably less than 10 years old. Why would someone use the dangerous G92 workshift in a modern machine?That's wild.It's the V0. That's triggering the alarm, you don't have a Y axis on that machine by the looks of it.Fanuc is Fanuc. It all pretty much behaves the same since the 80s.What is your question?I wrote a quick macro for our Makino when we first got it.. it is only really for 4 axis parts, where you set G54 as the front face, G55 as left, g56 as right.It takes your offsets from G54, then does the correct calculations based off of the position and the stroke of the machine to generate the G55 / G56 offsets.To be honest, it's much better to just set up your cam software to have your parts in a known location in space, and program from Centerline of pallet out. Everything turns out perfect.Or, you can program from centerline out, and then set one or two quick offsets (Y or Z usually) if the part is further down / up in either axis. You just probe the part, offset it the correct amount and you're good to go.its been a while but I've always thought G54.2 is used more for tracking than "finding the other faces of the part".Example: You have a point you want to track on a 4 axis horizontal. X1. Y0. Z5.You rotate 90 degrees on B and if you have G54.2 activated then The machine will know the new value of the point is X5.Y0.Z1.G54.2 doesn't allow for dimensions only offsets. So the machine still wouldn't know the "other" faces.I haven't used either machine enough to have an answer, but I do have a question. Is this not something you would deal with in some CAM software? How much of this is being done using the machine interface?I can't tell you for sure how to do it but we typically use a machine specific gauge to get lined up then just reset the g54 and viola. My question to you once you solve this conundrum is what type of gauge or positioning you use to ensure geometric alignment is inspec while doing so.No m code, you'll have to use the m code to bring the tool setter down(should be easy), then feed onto it(should be super easy), then a short macro of some sort to alarm out if it doesnt touch(super not easy)Yeah looping is easy. You can reference the variable to print with a variable.Example500=100 (This would be your variable spread beginning number)While [#500LE200]DO Dprint A#[#500]500=#500+1ENDWHILEI don't recall the syntax for dprint but the above would simply loop and write variables 100-200 through dprint. The A in dprint is just for the sake of example.to me it could be worth it write a separate dprnt for each variable. this way you can label your outputs, unless you just want just a ton of data seperated with a comma or new lineI assume you're connected to some sorta dnc software that will log each rs232 output individually?I did something like this a while back on a Fanuc 31i. I was able to connect to the ftp server being ran off my computer and output a .dat file. Only problem was they were all named file.dat and would override each other. I was going to write a script to automatically archive and rename each file as it was uploaded, but management changed their mind and didn't want to spend the machine time to probe or inspect the part.https://www.cnczone.com/forums/attachments/2/0/9/2/4/3/174549.attachCTR+F "Relative Position" in that PDF .Page 261 maybe. Give er a read though.Seems to have been fixed. Changed bit 3104.3 from 1 to 0Sounds like you may have dropped some safety interlocks somewhere. If you don't use any gate or fence interlocks, check to make sure the fence circuit is jumpered. If you do use them, that's where I'd look first.I'm a Fanuc robot expert, not too much on the CNC side.Call Russell @ Anca he can sell u a new machine... :)I've never seen a machine index without user inputDon’t call up the tool change? Mill is M6 and lathe is a T block. Avoid programming those and you succeeded at not indexingTry pushing (or dead blow hammering) the turret the direction it was going at it’s last index. I’ve not ran a Nak but if an old Mori doesn’t catch the turret indexing pin the right way, it doesn’t seat, and no alarms or anything but the machine won’t move. I started pushing on it for a while and felt it nudge back into position and voilaThere is a pneumatic cylinder that fires a tapered locking pin into the drive shaft to lock the alignment for indexing. I have seen worn belts jump teeth and cause misalignment, a broken proximity switch that picks up the bolt and a sticking magnetic switch on the pin. You may get a "knock pin not engaged" alarm. If you can turn the live tool when the machine is off, the pin is not engaged and will be either the proximity sensor or worn belt. If the tool is locked in the correct orientation, it is most likely the magnet switch on the cylinder.Ok. This is sometimes said as a joke but we occasionally have to do this with the HAAS machines :Turn it off, and back on again?Home and tool change position might be two separate coordinates? On my vmc1000 the z of home and the z of tool change are about 40-50mm apart... Also, physically make sure the sensors are doing what they're supposed to. I had an old YAM that error'd out on a spindle position sensor (an old Omron thing that was looking for a koblet on a giant gear on the spindle). Took me 2 days because the diag only SOMETIMES made it show a 0 instead of 1...Pay the money for the post and support. A cam software is only useful if it outputs code you don't need to edit. Post language is not usually in g-code format and requires you to know another computer programming language, plus one small change can impact the entire post.Most likely C++ but I dunno. Esprit is. And it fucking sucks writing postsMy immediate reaction was to suggest switching over to Fusion. Only because I use their generic fanuc turning post for our 3 axis lathe.On a lathe why not canned cycle? G76?In a word, yes. G92 boring cycle steps up the major by the same increment every time, specified by I (? been a minute) value.G76 threading cycle steps up the major by decreasing increments, and at an angle so that the threading insert cuts primarily on the leading face, but that angle can also be dictated using A valueTypically no. The quill axis is generally not meant for heavy use. You set it to where you need for reach then use the Z axis for work. There may be a way but not one I am familiar with. But my only experience with a W quill axis is on a horizontal bar.Can’t you just use W instead of Z in your G73 line?How deep down the rabbit hole do you want to go?I remember my grandfather sitting me down as a young boy and reading to me from the good book. The mcmaster carr catalog. It truly contained the answers to all life's questions.When he starts school he'll be able to tell the teacher to take and endmill, sit on it and G00 in z while doing a G02Oi Model F that sounds like a milling machine manual. If i was a Father and I saw this, I would definitely approve!!! lolAt least it's the DVD manual and not the encyclopedia-thick manuals for the 1iC, oiA, wire edm machines.Break out the ladder diagram for bed time, he will be asleep in notimeIf you run Fanucs, they have a great app for alarm codes and troubleshooting.I just looked it up on there, and it says this is a CPU Interrupt alarm. It says most likely you have a bad main PCB in the control.That said, if you're getting this when sending a program via RS232, make sure no characters are in the file outside of the %.Otherwise, likely to be that PCB, which means you're possibly replacing the control.I just want my Fanuc to stop flipping to the Alarm page every time the head flips out of a 5-axis position... Tired of seeing "B axis blocked" when it's not actually an issue.Hold the delete, P and R keys wile powering the machine up. It will give you a great list.I'd love a copy! Been fighting with an old 0m!What fancy controllers?I’d be very appreciative if I had these.We used MasterCam but espirit is supposed to be great for multiaxis wireWhat about the on board software?15 years back, I worked for Methods as a Fanuc WEDM apps engineer. Esprit was the company's tool of choice then. I never really cared for it, and could make parts way faster in Mastercam. Wire EDM programming is fairly basic compared to mills, especially if you're just doing basic tapers for die work.I’ve only ever used Esprit for wire EDM so that’s what I’m used to. It’s pretty straightforward for programming taper cuts.I’ve used Mastercam and Esprit. Esprit wins hands down. The UI is well laid out a very simple to use.Unrelated question - anyone aware of any good edm content/basics available online? Keen to learn moreProgrammed for wire burners at my last job using Esprit, definitely wasn’t doing anything crazy, but it worked fine for stamping die components.Esprit is good. Using Pepscam now. Large taper stuff might require a different wire though. Watch that tension on the finish passes. Too much tension might run really slow. Make sure you have high taper nozzles on too! Good luck.Not 100% sure if this is the case as l'm only well versed in Haas, but fanuc is fairly similar. You may need to remove the spaces from your GOTO commands. GOTO110 instead of GOTO 110.I have since added the brackets [#6711 LT 38] [#6711 GE 38]. Sorry guys didnt realize this was a older pictureI think it may have to do with the fact that i am trying to use system variables. Thoughts?That alarm means #6711 is not a valid variable. Where did you find the number?The manual for our 31i says #3901 is total number of parts, and #3902 is the required parts.perhaps put a . behind the 38.Here is what i made boys. No there is no tool life managment. This is my attempt at making artificial TLM.GOTO1000;N1000;101=#101+1;IF[#101LT38.]GOTO1010;IF[#101GE38.]GOTO1011;; N1010;G28Y0;M30;; N1011;M0 (REPLACE 3.8MM DRILL);M0 (DID YOU REPLACE DRILL);M0;101=0;G28YO;M30;;102=#102+1;IF[#102LT13.]GOTO1012;IF[#102GE13.]GOTO1013;;N1012;G28Y0;M30;;(BURKE 3/7/23);;N1013;M0 (REPLACE TAP);M0 (DID YOU REPLACE TAP);M0;102=0;G28YO;M30;;103=#103+1;IF[#101LT25]GOTO1014;IF[#101GE25]GOTO1015;N1014;G28Y0;M30;;N1015;M0 (COUNTER SINK);M0 (DID YOU REPLACE C/S);M0;103=0;G28YO;M30;6711 is a parameter, not a macro variable. Try reading #3901 instead. That’s the number of parts made.You can also read the parameter 6711 into a macro variable using G10.Abnormal voltage on the mains or on the DC bus?It’s a little thing, but I’ve lost time on it in the past: fanuc’s breakers flip green when they trip. Make sure all your breakers are red.Check all the fuses in the cabinet. And your incoming voltage.BE CAREFUL. Thats 480. DO NOT touch any capacitors!Do you have y-axis on your lathe?Because it's not a polar interpolation movement. It's just an XC movement. Polar interpolation refers to a movement like G1/G2/G3, which is being resolved from XY into XC.You need to turn on C-axis mode not polar coordinate modeId get that post fixed, no reason not toNo way around it sadly. I tried this using manual guide i on my fanuc control and had to figure out the positions using trig and program in c axis mode...What exactly are you trying to accomplish? You want your machine to read something other than 0 at the home position?I did this last week on an Fanuc 18T lathe. You could use a grid shift parameter and change the reference position to another location. Also be aware all the parameters use encoder counts as the unit of measurements.Get a helper press tool release and snack tool with dead blow not hard just a good bump. How is your drawbar setup csn you see the piston firing. Do you have enough air pressures?Trying to find some myself. Lots of stuff out there you can buy by the foot, but without knowing the profile shape I'm spinning in circles. Did you find a source or the right profile aftermarket? mine is a 1995 t-10bMaybe find a reputable mechanic. The wizard who repaired the machines at a place I used to work at was able to conjure some up for some 30 year old takisawas for many dollars per foot. I think it's out there, you just gotta know who to call.I absolutely loved the CUT 20P at my last job. We used EspritCAM with it, and it was just the easiest, most convenient thing to run.Latching doors eh...Gives me flashbacks to when I opened the doors to the submerged sinker. EDM oil all over the bosses shoes.I can eat off the floor and the walls in that room.I've run wires for 20 years, had Charmilles, Chmer, Sodick, Mits, Makino and Fanuc.Fanuc is the best, no question. Love those machines.That truly is very attractive, how much did this unit set you back?, i might be in the suprise market for such a wedm.How do you set up a part in one of these? Anyone have a YouTube link?I didn’t know they make EDM. I love our Robodrill. We should get one of these.AI HPCC parameters are determined by the machine tool builder - I’d start by contacting your dealer or builder first and confirm that the parameters in your control are correct.Look at the programming manual, there is a section about contour control that should explain the relevant settings. It may be a matter of calling the data via program rather than parameter settings.video of screen https://imgur.com/lMfS8dzWell the relative works like manual machines DRO. Basically no need to worry about it, you can use it to check things manually, it doesn't affect anything done by a program.You have to call up the tool if you’re manually set tools. Otherwise it should set up automatically on the geometry page when you bring the arm down.Doosan should have the tool setting program so you just hit the green button and follow the screen. It calls up M43 H#Are you on a lathe or mill?What does your program look like?If your finish tool is overcutting at the end of the path it usually means G42 cutter comp was turned on and your toolpath ended with a Z move. Always end your programmed path with an X move larger than the final final diameter size.Your cutter comp done did it.The shop I’m in is to small for a tending bot but the bigger shops I’ve been in all use FanucDepends some on the application. If you don’t go collaborative then probably FANUC. If you want it to be collaborative the options are more limited. UR has a good reputation but the robots themselves are not as durable as FANUC and generally the range of available robot sizes doesn’t go as big. It is nice not to have a cage around everything.My shop is running fanuc.I’ve only used Fanuc. Find out who can support you with service and training. If you buy something and never know how to use it, it’s not going to work.Shibaura, formerly Toshiba. Have many great robots with capabilities to meet all your needs.yaskawa, abb, fanuc, kuka the list goes on and on.Our shops use fanuc and straubli robots. We have a few pic and place integrated loaders and they suck for the most part. Have a couple Toshibas and they are a nightmare to fix.Hmm... It is possible that L cannot be a variable, but that is just speculation.I've always done repeat applications like this with WHILE loop.WHILE [#508 LE #509] DO1.........#508 = #508 + 1END 1I got it to work, however, I just found out this was a proprietary part, whoops. So I can help people with this in the future, but I can't keep it online.Task failed successfully, that's kind of a dope font.We have a takisawa lathe with turn-iI know literally nothing about that, but I've had this happen when doing right angle head work, and its usually because I screw up the mental gymnastics of the G18/19 plane change. I would think if this an onboard macro, it would already be proved out to work. I wouldn't think you'd have to go through and change all of the G02 to G03's but you never know. What variables do you have to work with?Well it zigged when it should have zagged. G2/G3 are reversed. Is the engraving cycle an on-board macro?I just had the same problem, you can change Parameter 27000 bit0(first from the right) from 0 to 1.Looks like G2s and G3s are flipped. You didn't happen to run this with any sort of axis mirroring enabled did you?I have seen robot arms setup for milling wood and foam with the spindle mounted on the end of the arm. I think your success in metals will depend on the specifics of the operation- in other words the exact material, type of tool/cutting operation and HP required relative to the rigidity of your specific arm + spindle setup.Also, someone correct me if I am wrong but I don't believe most basic cam packages would output code for this right out of the box. You'd probably be looking at one of the higher end CAM systems and possibly a custom postprocessor.I've seen it done to first mill then polish large lenses for the telescope industry. If I remember correctly it was just rough polish and couldn't achieve the proper finish so they had to finish it another way.The closest thing I've seen to this was essentially a die grinder used for deburring after removing from the machine, kind of like this, but it was one robot holding the part with a second robot doing the deburring work.Used to work at an aerospace firm that uses FANUC arms to grind down ECM flow ditches and do edge deburring with what is essentially a custom dynabride tool and Dremel with deburring brushes. I wouldn't say it was very accurate in terms of positioning but it got the job done by engaging a spring mechanism on the grinding arm to exert pressure. Varied the feed rate of the tool paths to remove more or less material.I can't speak to any tolerances that are achievable. But i had wondered this in the past and in one of my YouTube adventures found this. Hopefully this will at least give you some ideas.https://youtu.be/3o1waj2fxgYYour question made me think of this https://youtu.be/quN37YskoaMAlmost everything about a robotic arm's design is incompatible to rigidity. They're long, thin, noodly appendages with several joints, because people buy them for speed, accuracy, and flexibility.Machines and robotic arms are wonderful compliments to each other -- the size and simple structure reduces vibrations cheaply, while the arm extends the machines capabilities almost infinitely.Trying to replace one with another is only going to be more expensive in the long run. More expensive setups, more frequent and costlier maintenance, more expensive to fix after a mistake, etc.I've seen them used for deburring parts at one of the fanuc facilities.I've seen varying tolerances, some claiming .01mm at best. Still, it is typically in aluminum at best.A robot could probably drill and tap just fine. Perhaps do high-speed roughing too, but then for finishing I'm guessing you would out of luck.I think that the lower options up to 160m might not even require any additional memory. Since 2 of the 32kb SRAM modules are already present.The 10M-A, 10M-B and 10M-D (there is no 10M-C because the D stands for Digital) are all totally different controls. You could say which control you have.The 10M-D is a great, powerful control. The others not so much.I have upgraded the memory to 256k on a 10M-D. But I used Tulip parts.If you figure it out post what you find.BTW, the memory upgrade parts are not thousands. They're like $500.There's no secret parameters. You input the memory size in hex when you initialize the control.If you've never done this hire a tech because it's not as straightforward as it sounds..05mm is nothing. You should always drop your wear offset some after you touch it off anyway.And you will have to ask Mori on how to calibrate the probe because every machine tool builder does it their own way even when the control is Fanuc.It’s a lot more involved that simply changing a parameter.In the row of buttons for the display(Prog, Pos, Offset, etc.) there should be a button labeled "Cust 1", if you hit it it might take you into a screen that has G-code and M-code soft-keys that will show you the whole list. This is an optional feature on Doosan/Daeewoos though so you might not have it.Ya the rapids are pretty insaneI ran on those so many times. Honestly it is mostly great, though if it runs long enough it tend to have problems with toolchanger. That and lights usually break is only problems I know of.I use a robodrill from time to time. If you are a true rookie keep the rapid turned all the way down till you know things are good. 100% rapid on the one that I run is crazy fast. Learn G and M code. Check out the tech schools in the area. Never stop learning and be safe.We're doing that at college - I think it might be the same model too. Last Tuesday the instructor deliberately sabotaged the Z- feedrate in the code (the code that he promised us was fine and would work) to show us what can happen when a machine crashesThe 1" aluminum cube looks like it got shotHoly shit, what excellent timing. My boss wants me to take on a second machine, and this is it. I might learn something from this thread.I’d say great first machine to learn on. BT30 is pretty weak but as long as you take gentle cuts it’s great. But ya crazy rapid speeds, just turn the rapid down for a while.Original memory was 20m, now it has 480m. So 24 times more memory than originally. Just ordered same SRAM chips from China that were originally installed on the machine and enabled the correct parameters using memex instructions. Cost about 20€, memex price for the kit that you install yourself would be 700€.. I also will do the same for my VMC once I get it running again...I believe, on Fanuc, your absolute is reading height from table, calibrated before sending machine out. I am fairly certain this is a hard code software implementation to help protect the machine from crashes. And to change this, you may need a tech out to override fanuc lock outs. I am assuming you're using a vise, considering the rough offset example.Don't you have to activate the tool height offset on MDI first? G43 H1?Never seen that before.If the Absolute is reading Imperial and the programs run properly, the Machine Numbers don't really apply.Older Heidenhain iTNC had Datum and Tool tables that did that, annoying.Batteries maybe?G21?Solved:Parameter 3104 bit MCN needs to be 1I have only done repairs on Haas, but I would test the sub spindle amp with an ohm meter. You will need to find a guide online for what ohm meter readings should be. I know for a fact there is a guide for a Haas style amp on haascnc.com under service tab look up amp troubleshooting. Just make sure to turn off power for at least like half an hour and label and disconnect leads before taking a reading/ the power will stay in the buss a while. If you have 2 same amps you could also swap and see if the alarm changes. (So like swap sub spindle and spindle amp) When the amp in question is out be sure to look for burn marks on the sides to indicate a burned out component. Again this is Haas specific, but on Haas the amp will go to the main con which is basically like a computer motherboard. I have also seen such errors from a cable not fully seated so that would be a good fast check. Hopefully it’s not the board itself because that’s crazy expensive. Could also be a simple cable but that’s not common in that location on a Haas at least.The FSSB is the fiber optic connection between drives. Normally when this stuff happens it's in the drive itself. I'll look at notes tomorrow. Does it have an axis that comes up with the alarm?but I'm the guy who says "sure I'll try to fix that" when asked.Stop trying to do what you are not paid to do.In my opinion, it’s most likely a timer set for 60 second, that starts after an M-code command was issued to index the turret and the output for unlock turret was set but the input from sensor was not activated.If the turret locks/unlocks with hydraulic, I’d start there.⁠Check if PMC output for solenoid is 1⁠Check if solenoid on the valve gets power⁠Check if valve moves when solenoid gets power (should hear a faint clicking sound)⁠IF it does not move, Put machine in JOG, remove solenoid caps from valve and manually move the valve to see if turret locks/unlocks. Easiest way to confirm this is by looking in the PMC if it gets input from sensor for lock/unlock.⁠IF it does move, you may have a problem with the hydraulic pressure or the valve does not open completely due to contaminated oil. It could also be that it unlocks physically, but the sensor to confirm unlock is busted or a wire is bad.There is some steps. Without knowing the machine, electrical & hydraulic schematics and being able to look at the PMC program it’s hard to know exactlyHave you tried turning it off and back on againIt’s actually most likely has to do with your live tool orientation prox if applicable. Check the rung in the ladder. This is common on a lot of older Korean machines. Take the top sheet metal off the turret cover (to the right behind it) switch is mounted lower left in opening. It is either on the fence, or has a bad cable or switch. Verify in rung but it needs that before turret index for verification of safe movement on key ways. Comment #1 isn’t wrong about troubleshooting further. But I’ve seen this issue a lot. It’s almost always the orientation Input for live tool.She's fucked.Is the turret unclamping/ clamping at least?I install these in the UK. Go to offset page and across to operator panel and it should have an option for turret test. Turn this on and use jog and MDI to clamp and unclamp the turret. If it doesn't clamp or unclamp them it's a hydraulics issue.Solenoid is more than likely stuck, causing the time out issue...Try and trip the Solenoid.To be honest you would probably have better luck in practical machinist. But as far as your problems go, I run a fanuc robo drill pretty regularily. The zero return on that machine does the same thing, there may be a parameter to make it only home when you hit positive but the things cannot be entirely mistake proof so all I can say to that is just be careful. If it is an older machine it is likely that you will not be able to jog two axes at once. The rapid over ride does stop at zero in my machine as well(I am guessing you meant rapid override not feed because feed override is a percentage of the modal feed rate.), we have adjusted the 25% down to very slow for proving code and 0 is still set at stop. so to answer your question there is a way to adjust the override rate with parameters, if you are willing to upload some pictures of your manual I may be able to help you further.What control model is it? You can find most parameter manuals online with some digging. I don't know why Fanuc doesn't have any of their manuals available on their website. I think I have the manual for an ancient 0 series.Also does the machine have dogs and switches at the limits? I've never seen a machine that didn't, even with absolute encoders.As far as the rapid over ride those are generally responsive so you can toggle that between 1% and 25% when you feel comfortable. I usually stop it completely when the tool is going down. Eyeball it and check the distance to go. Check the code. I also go through all of the z moves in the program if it is simple. Which on a VTL it probably isn't that complex.Jogging in two axis isn't going to happen if it is an older machine. I am happy if it just stops when you over travel it while feeding in jog mode. Instead of alarming out and requiring a reset. I rarely see any new vtls. They are all old as shit.Some people make endmills, I break endmills.God I miss building shit like this.Beautiful.Awesome. What brand endmills are these?All you guys are so lucky with your fancy new toys. Here I am fighting with a 30 year old Fryer all day.FANUC =GLADOS. Let the testing begin..Nice! Do you find it reasonable to program for other parts?Should cross post to /r engineeringpornThat robot doesn't look like it offers any cycle time improvements over a human operator. Is it not possible to turn up the feed rates?This is dope! Could you maybe post more about the process of making endmills? I’ve always been amazed at these tools I use everyday, but have no idea where they come from.18i is pretty much universal control with minor diffs pending machine make. I’d say it’s more about the CAD/CAM selection.We've got 3 identical machines. Two unlock the door at M30, the other one does not. Nobody has been able to change it for years.XD I don’t know but good Lord I want to play with those buttonsThat has nothing to do with Fanuc. It has to do with how the machine was setup from the machine tool builder, in this case, Daewoo.Most likely it's a parameter or a keep relay. Call Doosan and see if they can help with that.If you have a copy of the ladder then look for the door lock keep relay and then you can change that PMC parameters. If you don't have the ladder diagram then call doosan and they will provide you the information. It should be at no cost as it's a option you could choose for free from the factory.The door interlock key should have 2 bolts in it that you can take out. Once you have the key off, stick in the locking mechanism. Make sure the bracket that it was once bolted to doesn’t hit it every time you close the door, or that will bend something eventually. Enjoy your big boy machine.You actually let the doors lock? LolWorks on Puma 8, Puma 250, Puma 2500, Puma 15, Puma 400, Puma 700, but not on this Puma 3100?Is it new or new to you? If new, call sales, they should be able to get you in touch with tech support, or call fanuc directly. They are usually pretty helpful with stuff like this I have found. My guess, there is a setting in parameters that is not allowing certain things. Fanuc is pretty good about keeping the same syntax across the board, but I know they do have parameters to change certain things. If you have the manual for the controller, that helps (with fanuc, it's usually correct, at least)Oh, looking at your code, g70 for finish won't leave material iirc, you would have to use g71 d400 to do a semi finish pass, I think. So that it doesn't do steps. I can't find any fanuc documentation one way or the other, but if you are able to use u and w in g70 on other machines, my guess would certainly be that there is a parameter to change it to allow it to accept a uw in g70.I know on the old Doosan I ran with fanuc control you could set the g71 to either follow the profile of g71 while roughing or leave it as steps. We had it set to follow the profile so after it was roughed there were no chunks/large steps to semi finish off before finishing.Is it just me or don't you need a G2 or G3 to cut your R1.5? In your G71 section it's a G1. That might affect how the machine reads it and be taking off the stock you're looking to leave. How does the part measure right after your G71 finishes and before your first G70?God, I should know this, if you go to the parts counter it gives an average cycle time (assuming this is a production machine). I think you'd have a better time using your cam though, that's one of those things that's always bugged me with Fanuc.When I took Entrepreneurship in college a lifetime ago, one of our professors started the first day of class by saying "When you work for yourself, you can choose your own hours. Pick any 20 hours of the day you wish".Either cut back on the jobs you take or hire someone. The thing is with hiring someone the administrative expenses (workers comp ins, payroll taxes,....) also becomes quite a burden. So you need to weigh the pros/cons carefully.If you plan on growing, hire. If not, cut back.Edit: just reread your post. Apparently you have ee's. I'd vote for hiring someone. Even if it's a PT person.Tell that robot to get off his ass and load some parts.“If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.” Warren BuffettAt least nobody's gonna tell you to stand up and find something to doThe main reason I will probably never go out on my own for anything. Getting stuck working more hours than I currently am to make the same money or less. Even making more money wouldn’t be worth it if I had zero time that wasnt workingSame here 11:15pm here and I have to have this part ready for my day job tomorrow morning. 7:00am.Its Sunday, go homeI need some help resetting an alarm code, 9031 sspa: 31. Got a bit too ambitious and bogged down the spindle drilling in stainless. I am used to manual machines where the alarm is when all hell breaks loose. I just do little maintenance projects and repairs, using this fancy machine in manual mode using the hand wheels since they hauled my beloved manual lathe. I need to get back to making chips, how do I reset this beast? Any help appreciated. I suspect cycling the power will do it but trying to learn something.Cycle power to clear the alarm.Is there a tiny little button on the back of the panel you can only push with a paper clip or something of the sort.Pretty sure you tripped a breaker. Open the panel and be sure nothing is tripped.These errors came up after inserting a wrong option parameter and no it won't clear by clearing the memory by pressing 7 and 9 when booting and inputting all options as zeros. Motherboard shows E and the watchdog led is lit. Fuck around and find out I guess. I can pay someone if they know how to figure this out without calling a tech if it's possible. The machine was all functional before this and I have a fresh backup. I have loaded parameters several times before successfully.Think of work offsets as a zero for each part and/or setup and are individually adjustable.The shift function adjusts ALL work offsets by that amount.Workshift value on the 21i is the distance from the machine's home position (X all the way up and Z furthest point away from chuck) to the part's face which is your Z0.Does the machine have G54 to G59 work offsets too? Some machines don't as it was an option depending on the machine builder.When you are in the workshift page, do you see the X and Z Workshift on the left of the screen and X and Z Measurement on the right of the screen?If yes, bring your tool to the face of the part, use the cursor to highlight the Z in the Measurement side, type 0.0 and hit Input. Now the value of Z Workshift on the left of the screen should change.Move the turret home, go to MDI and enter a couple of blocks ocode to verify that the workshift is set correctlyT303; (or whatever the number of the tool you used to set Z zero)G0 Z0.0;Then hit cycle start. Obviously your rapid override should be to the lowest settting to be safe.M codes tend to be builder specific outside of the most basic M03-M04 etc.Mine is M51M51 = ON M59 = OFFOn the one I use.If you aren’t comfortable in the ladder already stay out!!! BUT that’s the only surefire way to see what mcodes are used/active. Best bet it check the op manual because all machine tool builders are different in their mcode choice, or ask the same question for your exact machine.Yea I’m not sure I tried all those and still nothing. I’ll keep plugging away at it I have a manual button I can push. Thanks for all the suggestions!Take tools out of the spindle and turn your rapid and feeds down, m17 and m18 are usually on/off for air blower.If you have an auxiliary button you can press that, then you might see what m codes are active on your MDI screenMine is M80 to start the air cycle.From my memory I think it’s m114, I may be wrong thoughFrom my memory I think it’s m114, I may be wrong thoughM57 on m67 off for mineI literally just solved this a few weeks ago.You're going to need a 256mb card. Anything bigger, no matter how you format it, it won't like it. Most likely won't like the USB. There's something about the type of micro flash as well, the slowest kind are the best.Obviously YMMV, if I get the chance tomorrow I'll get a picture of the card for you.There are alternatives as well, I/0 #9 is ethernet (CD38 or 39?). You can usually find the port in the back, always keep the power off when you're in the cabinet. And you can use a focas tool (focas is a fanuc thing.) Do you have predator? Are you doing remote? Get the manual out.You gotta build a rs-232 with the proper handshaking pin layout. Serial port rs-232 crossover cable.This is a good thread with a lot of info about your problemhttps://www.cnczone.com/forums/fanuc/16270-fanuc-11m-rs232.htmlAny luck with manuals search?Idk lmao I’m going to try: don’t take my word for itTop, left to right Spindle jog, MDI, cycle start, feed hold Bottom, left to right Power off, power on, b handle +, b handle -, the last one looks kinda like handle for a tilting head? Is this a 5-axis? Lmao2 yellow buttons look like manual tool change buttons red is power off button next to it is power on. Square with arrows is probably cycle start.Update for closure, I had to hit the door button. 🙄*0.5 mm DOCI ran the very first cut at 1mm DOC 1000rpm and 4.5m/min and almost stalled the spindle on contact, 4m/min sits around 110% load, dropped the DOC and dialled in the feed to what is in the video (still 1000rpm)You're missing a brain! Pretty sure 18 needs a CNC basic unit (looks like an amplifier) as well as the screen. You can takw your pick over those, they come in all shapes and sizes. We used a tiny little motor for calibration for our test stand and stored it in the cabinet fully wired. Then plug in a seperate motor if you need to test is as the 206 amp will drive two motors. Also, that amp in particular is NOTORIOUS for frying in short order but they're pretty ubiquitous.Seems rational. It's going by the file header and not the file name.P sure it’s ordered by last modifiedBecause we did it that way in 1970, when we pioneered the CNC controller, and we'll keep doing it that way forever! Never deprecate anything!I can see you've got an old 16i, which is no longer sold new but will be supported until the end of time, so you're at least benefiting from this somewhat.Real question is why G73/G83 can't dwell at the bottom of the hole on a fanucOn the Fanucs I use you have to curser over on the top row, between No., File Name, Size, etc. You might have it sorted by date or something else rather than File Name (which should be highlighted if it is sorting by that)Self taught everything robots/plcs/automation. Biggest thing is making that stuff safe and being safe while you mess around since you are likely going to be doing a lot of "mess around and find out" for science of course!Outside of that is to start by literally writing out by hand, step by step, what you want to do in whatever program you are in. This is known as stub programming and will really help you break it down into manageable bite-sized chunks. It seems stupid but I cannot tell you the number of times that I've walked away for an hour, came back to code I just wrote on the teach pendant, and was like "what idiot wrote this and what does it mean".In general, Fanuc TP programs are like NC macro programs on steroids as there is a TON of stuff that is hidden a few layers deep, so if you are comfortable with the aspect of using variables and subroutines then you will probably have an okay time grasping that on a robot.Biggest question that comes to mind is, are you guys not using palletized or zero point workholding for your machines?Haven't worked with fanuc but I've worked with some cobots, and watched some fanuc classes on YouTube.Honestly I think any CNC programmer could pick it up pretty easily. It's not very different in terms of how the code works.I'd check out some YouTube videos, there's a series from some tech college, I don't remember the name. And then next time the robot is sitting idle while you're running a job, see if they'll let you play with it.Only real hazard is making sure your playing around doesn't interfere with what they already have set up for the jobs it does run. And integrating whatever new programs you make into the existing setup. I'm sure you'd be in deep shit if the expensive robot people have to come out to clean up your mess.Do it.It's not that hard, and it will put you at an entirely different level.Buy the one of the Fanuc textbooks and work through it. Programming Fanuc Robots for Industry Applications is probably well worth the $99 on Amazon to upskill yourself.I promise you won’t learn much more taking a class, you just work through a book. I’ve taken both Fanuc integrator training at Fanuc North America and a collage level Fanuc robotics course and they don’t really teach you anything application specific.I have been mucking around with USB to Serial adapters for ages. Frankly the best option is a PCI to serial card:https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Bds9WtqJS._AC_SL1000_.jpgUSB might deregister and come back online because of static electricity or Windows being Windows or whatever. You don't notice that on your Keyboard but this will mess up your 45min running job in an instant.PCI cards are the next best thing to a dedicated Serial port.I just purchased a FTDI USB to RS232 for a 1993 ZPS VMC and it drip feeds from predator to the machine using Buffered input on the machine no problem. Just have to download the correct drivers and it works. This is also on a Dynapath delta 50 control so it’s not entirely the same but with this cord I am able to drip feed a 30 year old control with a new computer.My live tool codes aren't the same as you codes, so can you mark up your program with what the non-standard codes are? Such as M17, G113, G18. That may help figuring out what has been forgotten.Try a G18 after your M9.Post your code?Did you try // instead of /2? My machine has three block skip functions, /, //, and /// My control is an older FanucNot sure if it will help but on ours we use the /2 to call a sub and the sub contains the M51....../2 M98 P7008........%O7008M51M99%Hope that helps.This is awesome. I love it when others leave comments to give context. This is especially useful when I want to adjust a particular feature deep in the program like a spring pass taper adjustment on a finished feature. It saves a lot of time and actually minimizes risk of making an incorrect change of value.This is how it should be.It drives me mad when I pull up an old program and there are no fucking comments at all explaining how to run it.I would hire you in a second.Your coworker is a fool. What can having relevant info in the program hurt?I do all the programming and machining in my shop, and I don’t treat myself nearly as kindly as you are treating your machinists. I would have zero complaints if I had to run one of your programs.Compromise: tell operator to goto Nxxx to read setup info instead of having it all at the top.Everything was set correctly How to perform the zero ruturn position ?ThanksThe back of the machine should have a booklet with all the parameters on it.Yeah that's a fun game, filing in all these buggers. Good luck!Dealers won’t supply wiring info? Are you saying you don’t have wiring diagrams in the service manual!?!?Its very unlikely that the wiring is the problem and its not the interlock itself, however if you get me the exact model of robodrill ill see if i can get you a pdf wiring manualYou could post some more details and someone might be able to help. The diagnostics and ladder are very useful in troubleshooting fanuc controls.Not familiar with doosan but on our fanucs: first press feed hold, then change mode to handle, then spindle stop, then door open - button.Then when you want to resume, change mode to auto again and press cycle startIf it’s a new doosan with fanuc i series. Feed hold. Turn coolant off. Then turn your spindle override knob to 0.To resume do it in reverse order.I can get you numbers in the morning, not sure your time zone but im UTC -7. My cutting parameters are at work.First program and you're at 50% rapids and asking for luck? Sometimes you have to make your own luck.Damn that control is sexyIs the control language in danish?God damn the smooth controllers are so fucking nice! Our i300S is still using the Nexus 2 :(First program, Wish me luckR[#502125400] > R[#5021*25.4]R[#502225400]> *R[#5022**25.4]Machine needs a metric value to set secondary positions.

There’s no joke 4-6 mistakes.I remember when my hope got drilled. About 20yrs ago, thanks corporate America.Fanuc manuals are a wellspring of Jinglish grammar.It doesn't have gears . It has an electronic High / Low wind on the motor . M261 low . M262 highDoes it actually have a hi and low gear? May need an m34 for turning mode before you can do a gear change in a program. At least that’s how our Puma VTL is.On my puma 2500 LY its M61 for low speed & M62 for high speed , Maybe try that ?For some reason my text didn’t go with the post. It has a button where you can switch high/low gear while in Handle mode. But when we call up m41/m42 mid program it will just sit there on the code idle. I’ve tried calling up p11 to designate main spindle. Maybe I’m missing something.Kick it?May not even have a high and low gear. Just because a button is there doesn’t mean the actual thing is there.Should do it automatically. Mine sits in high gear while the spindle is off.You mean under CNC memory on the programs page? I think you can just type in the name/number and hit the down arrow but I'm not standing in front of a control to try it.O-searchIn the actual folder should be a “get” or L-get command along with an execute or L-execute command. Should be on fanuc-i controllers. If there is let me knowEdge precision on YouTube is well edited and a ton of knowledge about processes, planning, and machining from a “real shop” (not a YouTube shop).Get the Peter Smid books.Sink or Swim by Tom LiptonMachine Shop Trade SecretsHere is Haas’ Mill Programming Workbook. Great if you’re learning FANUC.Computer-Aided Manufacturing: CNC Lathe, Probing & FMS by SK Sinha. He frequently offers this book for free on Amazon if you check his Free CNC Resources thread on Practical Machinist. I bought the paperback version though. It is mostly aimed towards Fanuc lathes and is meant for absolute beginners. I am far from a beginner but I have still found lots of value in the book. I highly recommend it.Read the entire machinist handbook between cycles.The older fanuc controls would use cursor down. So in edit mode you would call O0025 then the down arrow. Maybe worth a shot?Yeah, I've often thought this too. But machine tool and control makers often only allow such a feature in a setup mode if equipped.In situations where it would be nice to have I have either used lots of IF/THEN/ELSE/WHILE statements or made the programs parametric and variable dependent. Unless it comes up a lot it's probably not worth fitting a button to a machine for a few extra lines of codeI think what you are looking for would be a machine specific M-code. Can you not work around it with an if statement?Block skip state is normally stored in both the PLC and the Parameters. However, the location is controlled by the machine tool builder.I have done what you are looking for by reading the parameter associated with block skip to determine whether it is on or off. For instance; last time I did this on a MORI. It was parameter 6445 bit 7Should probably specify which Fanuc system we're talking aboutCould you wire the switch backwards? Or maybe just loosen it on the panel and rotate it 180 deg if its a flip switch maybe?No, but can I ask you what the main purpose of these Robodrills are for (obviously drilling) but why do shops buy them (when they have other CNCs)?I'll just start with the obvious is it plug in and turned on?If water got in you might have some corroded contacts. If your comfortable you could open it up and take a look. Other wise I would just call a tech.Are the lights on the buttons on? If not maybe a tripped fuse at the back of the m/c?I know it will sound stupid but you know how the saying goes... Have you tried giving it a light bop to the right of the logo above the screen?I've got an old controller that the screen blacks out from time to time but everything is still running fine. Had our electrical engineers look at it and they could find any issues. Idk why I thought to try it but i bumped it with the side of my first and I'll be damned it lit back up.Would advise that this is my solution because replacement of my controller might not be possible due to age and model. So ymmv, good luck buddy.If the machine comes ready still it is definitely a display issue and not a controller issue. They don’t typically make some of the LCD screens anymore so there’s likely going to be a replacement. To determine the right replacement give Fanuc a call/email. If you have the data sheets or the part number for the display unit, that will be needed. You can try the A02B part number that’s on the back of the yellow case right behind the screen, but that doesn’t always give the information needed. You could also try the serial number that’s on that sticker on the yellow case there, Fanuc might have records of what is on that control from that.Probably just because Fanucs are really popular and shops in a lot of cases try to stick to the same control just for ease of use.You can probably order them with a Seimens or Heidenhan controller too, if you that's the flavor you like.Is it to do with how many zeros are in your O number?You can only use O1001 - O8999 as program numbers on the old fanuc controllers everything else is protected I think. Can’t use anything past 4 digits after the O****For some reason fusion will add a million zeros to numbers in the back ground (dump file) then that gets converted by the post to Gcode so make sure your post is rounding to the correct number of zeros. I’ve written many many posts. If you need help further please pm me and I’ll see what I can do to help/ see if we can get you a working postCould do a 7 degree tapered endmill with a relief grind to avoid the counterbore and a normal endmill for the cb. Probably not the best way but it'll save you the math. Don't know if award does a 7 degree mill buy we run the 10 degree ones and they're great for the price, carbide is like $20 for a 1" doc and the hss is even cheaperTapered end mill, maybe?Helical interpolate with a small corner rad bullnose endmill, like 0.01" rad. That shallow of an angle and you won't even be able to tell that there is a rad in the corner.I do that shit all the time and it's fine. If the mating part doesn't account for a small inner rad then the engineer needs to go back to school to learn how to design parts for the real world.Swept surface helical down the wall with a flat bottom endmill after rough out.(Its what my Hurco calls it)A CAM software would hit this no problem with and endmill.But SF may be to good right.The 64-125 ra may be a problem. You may want to get a tappered endmill and add in scallops to it as to create the specified surface and maintain it.Rough, semi with flat bottom, and ruff up suface is what I would do.I have done this a few times. On aluminum for some sort of press in plug stopper.Perhaps a single point threadmill, programmed to helical interpolate to get 90ra down the taper?You have options I think.You can buy tapered end millsA assume you are milling it from the top? Drill it and then helical bore it with a radiused slot mill. Hogging is out of the picture with that strategy and you'd have to have one lying around that's the right size to enter the hole and reach the sides at the bottom. Leave some stock you can fuck around a bit with speeds/feeds for a good finish.If bottom, circular bore with a bullnose. Swarf it if you wanna show off.For a turret mill ( Bridgeport) Put it on a rotary table and tilt the head ...I'm assuming you don't have access to cam or custom tooling or you wouldn't be asking this question. Either of those would be simple enough.I would use a macro program to cut the angle/radius with a sharp cutter. Leave a few thou to clean up and keep your step over low. Feel free to dm if you need an example.The Fanuc CRX are NOT as easy to program as they claim. That is unless you're well trained on the yellow ones. Super pissed we already paid for 6 of them.UR robots are super easy to program but can't handle coolant.If you have any specific questions just ask.Cobot safety still depends on what you put on the end of the arm. Put a knife as end of arm tool and you still need traditional safety systems in placeCobots are marketed as portable and flexible, meaning they can and should be moved around the shop. Reality is they are hard to justify this way, they get purchased for a specific purpose and do mostly that one thing.Of curiosity, why do you need the original ip? Are you not able to set it to whatever you would need?Makino likes to rename the fanuc controls, so does mori seiki, you can program that from a cam system, and make it dance like a real cute poodle!, take the back cover off the control panel, check what model of fanuc it is, find a programming manual, or post processor for cam. Given it has an RS232Looks like a good machine!Never seen one, but that looks like a great find! I had no idea Makino made a toolroom style CNC like that.Worst case, this would probably be an awesome candidate for a controller upgrade.Is that the same as the one Tom Lipton has?Mah-keeeen-ohhhhh.Nice. Looks like a fanuc control room. Never seen a toolroom cnc mill with a fanuc control beforeCall fanuc or the OEM.They'll send a tech on site to do it. It takes less than an hour. I used to do it when I was a service tech.fusion 360 will probably get you going. you may need a post processor written.Have you got those under power yet? I’d be real careful not to remove the machine batteries and risk losing your parameters. You’ll have to pick a CAD/CAM software that you want to go with. The most popular are Mastercam, Esprit, GibbsCAM, FeatureCAM, Fusion 360, there are others I’m forgetting. Fusion 360 will be the cheapest to get into. For free you can learn G code and program it by hand but that quickly becomes limiting. Best of luck!That's actually a pretty decent machine with a solid control. They changed the name to Doosan and now DNM Solutions but parts should still be available from Ellison. Any basic fanuc post will work. You will need some help with getting communications setup. I don't think that will have a USB drive. I still run a machine with an 18m control. If you need a mastercam post or help with loading programs hit me up. You'll need a custom cable.First you'll want to start by thoroughly cleaning them up, ensuring they power on, etc.Next you'll want to learn a CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) software and your choice will be dependent on what you intend to do with the machines. Will you be using them for commercial or hobby? Fusion 360 is a great software package for beginners. It is a fully-functional 3d CAD software with integrated CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) and there's a free hobbyist license with limited CAM capability.I know nothing about either of these machines specifically, but they'll both probably take serial communication of some sort from a computer meaning you won't need to manually enter the g-code (geometry code). Speaking of g-code, it's the programming language that CNC machines speak. I'd recommend picking up a book that explains g and m code (CNC Programming Handbook by Peter Smid is good). The CAM software built into Fusion 360 will export to this language.She looks tired but readyGonna need some more info that than budWhich Fanuc control does it have? Plus with things like bar feeding codes, the machine tool builder uses its own specific M codes and such. You might have to contact Doosan directly to help you figure it out. Doosan has good customer service.How is the barfeeder set up?Does it use chuck open/close signals to tell it to push or M Code to push?Either find a sampe code to use or you may have to write a barfeeder sub program from scratch.You'll have to look at 2 scenarios.When the Barfeeder has parts left in the bar stock and when the barfeeder has not parts left in the barstock.Have two subprograms or conditional jumps.1 to handle normal barfeeding routine.Position turretOpen chuckwait for barfeed complete signalClose chuckMove turret awayStart Processand one to handle when no parts are left, this subprogram will handle a new bar.. top cut etcYour barfeeder may have different functions on how it loads a new bar (Eject with a new bar or eject with the push rod)Best to find a manual for you barfeeder and investigate its parameter set up.What model is the bar feeder? I'm running a Doosan Puma with a bar feedC0.0 on both main and sub then transfer part. If your holding on both sides at once then still c0.0 on both spindles, move b over, grab with sub still on c0, unlock both spindles m34 and m134 then very slowly start to turn spindle speed up.Yes, I am trying to align tool with Milled feature on the first side of the part, and make "C0" offset to run live tool on second side. But when I double check "C0" after setting up my work offset part doesn't align with tool. So basically its keep changing "C0" offset.Make a fixture that aligns first side of part then adjust c axis offset for 2nd sideThere's likely an M code that turns on the C axis if you can't just command G0 C0. I think the Star I run is M8 to turn it on, M9 to turn it off. I don't think you can command M3/4 without turning M8 off.Or are you talking about orienting the part to the tool? Cause if you're trying to align the part, your best bet is probably to machine soft jaws to orient the part to C0.By C offset do you mean C work coordinate?Are you programming by hand or are you using CAM software of some kind? Where is the G50 coming from? I thought G50 was max spindle speed on FANUC, but I’m not super familiar with your control.Every fanuc I’ve ever worked on G50 is max spindle speed clamp and work offsets are G54-59. You need to set you work offset in the work page then call it up in the codeG28H0 G00C0This will take into account C Axis work shift.G50 C0 will reset C co ordinate to zero so the control won't apply the shift amount.If you're talking about the ladder I believe it's in system-->pmc-->pmcladBro just search only for a turenthttps://edoc.site/fanuc-ot-cnc-program-manual-gcodetraining-5881-pdf-free.htmlI know this post is old but I was wondering if you foumd anything that works. I am looking for the same thing but for a shop full of MazaksLadies and gentlemen, behold the Daewoo 6HS. Featuring the Fanuc 11T control. Has not made parts in more than a decade. Has not been turned on in more than 5 years. I keyed in my desired program, after we got the number 5 to work. Very important that all of the number keys work. Everything seems fine, except it will not execute a program. I have a LUB indicator LED illuminated. Filling the lube reservoir did not correct the error. I removed the lubricator, and on Monday I'm going to fill it with diesel to try to destickify (its a technical term, look it up) the decade old waylube.That looks like it belongs in an Aliens movieHow are the batteries not dead?? If you get her goin, better back up parametersI really like the VU meter for the load indicator. Much easier to see if you want to push a tool.That’s cool. Does it take tape?What machine is it?good enough for what?are you building this machine? or asking what some existing machine can do?Pictures make it look okay. Seems to be a standard VMC spindle.It is quoted as VMC 1270. Let me upload some pictures for you :)VMC 1270Fanuc Robocut 1000%. Ease of maintenance and service excels in the midwest. Most bulletproof Wire EDM's built in my opinion.I am biased towards Charmille because i have ran several of different machines but seems to me the shallowest learning curve. Plus support has been excellent. Unless you are doing production, i would stay away from add-ons like 3R chucks and other mounting systems. You will just end up making your own fixturss. I've only run Mitsubishi wires but I really like them. Guy I work with ran a Charmille before and likes that better but he's new to Mits so not sure if it's true or just a learning curve. Sodick is one of the best brands from what I've heard. Wire machines require a lot of matenience and know how to keep then running smoothly but they are capable of extremely tight tolerance work and provide a ton of unattended machine time.We have 2 WEDM machines, a Makino U3 HEAT and a Makino UP6 HEAT.Wire cutters can be maintenance heavy machines, there are a lot of filters, cleaning and other consumables that you have to replace periodically. Our machines are in excellent condition and I personally have held sub-micron tolerances on the UP6. How much you end up spending on the machine you're getting will depend on a few things; what kind of surface finish do you want to be able to achieve as well as what kinds of accuracy you want to be able to achieve. Machines capable of finer surface finishes as well as higher accuracies are going to be significantly more expensive. Although at the higher end there really isn't that much difference between machines and it's mostly just a case of which control software you prefer.Look for machines that completely submerge the part whilst it's cutting as that will give you more thermal stability (and won't make as much of a mess). Also check what wire diameter your machine takes, as thicker wire can cut faster but thinner wire can make finer shapes. We run .25mm wire normally but we can run up to .3 and down to 0.05mm wire (we've never actually used the 0.05mm wire, and the only places that I have even heard of using it were watchmaking shops).Obviously I'm bias towards Makino, but from what I've seen Fanuc and Sodick make some pretty good WEDM machines as well. Never encountered other brands so can't speak for them.Previously worked in quality for Makino and can say their machines are good. Training is great too for customers.I'd look at Mitsubishi and Makino. They have pretty solid machines.I only have limited experience with them, but we have 2 Onas, and I would definitely not recommend them. They work fine when the work, but when they don't it's an absolute nightmare to get them fixed and working again.Mitsubishi.UPDATE:I got the lathe back in operation today. It appears that when I replaced the battery on the servo controller, some parameters got goofed up and needed correcting, namely parameters 5 and 7. They were for some reason set for a 10 post turret, but mine is a 12 post. P5 went from 10 to 12 and P7 went from 1000 to 1200. So for anyone else banging their heads against a wall, check that out.Replying to this old post since it deals with a similar issue to what I’m experiencing.My 2047 alarm has also been dealt with in the past by changing the driver battery. Today, after sitting for about a month, received the same error. Changed battery but discovered turret was not in a locked position nor in the correct numbered position.Completed the driver reset procedure to “home” the correct tool # (1).Still showing the 2047 error though I can still cycle the turret by hitting “reset” and cycle before the error pops up again. Noticed after a while the turret is over-rotating about 1/8 and therefore not locking properly into position. Have to K5.4 back into locked position each time but still over-rotating. 2047 alarm is always up.Any thoughts?I've done this loads of times as well. At least you know its not a massive unsolvable issue. When you restart the machine, what code do you get on the turret servo driver box?Yes if you set these values in your G54,G55 whatever offset you would like to use and call that offset in your program as G54G91X0Y0Z0 you will return to these coordinatesDoes G54 G90 G0 X0Y0 take you where you need to be?Yah sorry G90 I fat fingered my phoneI've setup on slightly older vtcs before with the same controls. You set your g50 coordinates by going to settings, then hit page down several times until g54, g55, etc show up. The thing you are probably doing wrong is entering these numbers with a decimal. If I want to set g54 x for example I would goto settings, page down and then cursor over g54 x, and then type -87254. These particular controllers will not take a decimal for setting g50s. I can talk you through this over the phone if you need, or can take a video of myself doing this on a slightly older machine if you need me to. This is not an intuitive interface. If you are used to newer machines you can figure this out in 10 minutes but they have a few odd quirks. Good luck.Mine is k4.2Yeah, just edit the tool change macro to have M99 as the first line. Its often program 9001.You can always put a block skip on the tool change line and activate the block skip function in the control.Broadly speaking, robot arms are a commodity and you get what you pay for. It’s possible the Annin does what you need but the risk of something failing is much higher, and it will likely be slower. That said, you’re missing a giant chunk of the market between those two price points. Go look up Universal Robotics and see if any of those fit the bill - they’re very straightforward to set up and program. That's a hell of a heavy sphere. Denser than lead.Isn't a 2.5" steel ball about two pounds?In general you get what you pay for with industrial robots - the biggest factor you are paying for is uptime/reliabilityIf you need it to pick up those balls, 10 times a minute, for the next 7 years, and a dropped ball costs you 20k, you want the Fanuc.If your need is maybe not so strenuous, then you can probably get away with a less reliable unit. I suggest universal - they're an OK compromise.Alternatively, a used fanuc/abb/yaskawa arm might be a good option, if you don't have such stringent reliability and life requirements.Happy to discuss and make recswhat kind of robot do you need? anthropomorphic, scara, collaborative, carthesian, ...?Any speed requirement? what's the physical distance your spheres need to be moved? With what accuracy?How heavy are your spheres?Look at the 6 DOF xarm 6 from ufactorythe fanuc will perform 24/7 for the entirety of the installed life so long as it is programmed correctly. The annin will need support and service almost daily if not more, and it will wear out in less than a few years, in all likelyhood.close cough sophisticated salt automatic smell skirt numerous insurance society this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.devAny advice on getting my hands on a small to mid scale robotic arm, something around person scale? Been scanning eBay for a while and haven’t found anything in the price range you mentioned elsewhere. I’ve got a pretty strong EE/ME/Machining/embedded background but no Linux background from work so your arduino and hacked together approach sounds about right for me but trying not to spend 5k+.Just waiting for it to freak out and go through the wall.Beating a dead horse(robot)I tried finding the dang thing everywhere but no luckthe only place I found them was here:https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/stmbl_servo_motor_drive.htmlHowever that one says stmbl 4.3 ? how the github says 4.1... did anyone here get them from pcbway?What a goddam shame to leave that machinery out to the elements.Poor thing. :(Gorgeous, I will adopt youWow. What country is this?S-420iF. Those are early 90’s I believe.It is BumblebeeS420, source: industrial robotics guru who works at FRNA.Fun fact: The link arm behind J2, it doesn't exist on most newer models, but it still does in the software as J2/J3 interaction. It's representing the angles of the parallelogram created.This is why, when mastering these robots, it's necessary to master J2 and J3 at the same time.We have a FANUC in our shop, we bought it a while back but never got it fully running. It’s somewhat similar to the one in that picture.Seriously?? Robots on backyards looking for loving engineering-eyes to take care of them.. 😍😍GoddamCan you elaborate on what functionality is breaking between updates? What kinds of things are you doing with the force transducer? Mostly e-series robots or the CB series?The wrist camera is a little over $5400, I'm assuming you're buying them from a reseller who's buying it from a distributor. I completely agree with the Robotiq software. It's mostly bloatware and buggy. They are having a hard time keeping up wth UR's software updates.I've had fairly good experiences with the wrist camera EXCEPT for the cable, it's a common failure point and expensive to replace. The 1mm precision has been fine for us - mostly pick and place applications.The grippers have been mostly ok since the switch to the tool port comms on the e-series. I did have one lose it's ID# in a dual gripper app. but that was replaced.We did have a HUGE issue with using a wrist camera, gripper, and force co-pilot that caused major software slow downs and bugs in Polyscope. It was unusuable and took Robotiq a long time to fix.Robotiq has a great cobot buyers guide. I read it, its pretty nice. https://blog.robotiq.com/collaborative-robot-ebook?_ga=2.167186427.45260647.1523891909-1808103887.1516022592Fanuc has application engineers that will probably help you for free if you call or email themi have no experience with fanuc's new programming interface, but IMO UR's is better.mechanically, fanuc may have an edge over UR. but generally, UR's mechanics has improved over the last years, so i think you should be fine.i generally like UR for simple tasks. and they have very good documentation, which is not the case with fanuc. so i wouldn't worry too much about the switch.I’m working with an UR for about a year now in a couple of university project. It’s a capable platform and the forum is really helpful.This would have been cool 10 years ago. We have technology that's far superior to this right now. Who is this for?Picking up a golf ball with vision is much easier than most of the vision applications we see in the field where I work. Still cool to see but I agree with someone above that said this is a bit outdated. What trade show is this?FANUC has been operating a lights-out factory since 2001. Not many of those around, surprising given there were a few that started way back in the 1980s. I had expected them to be very common by now.Cool demo. I never understand why they don't just speed things up to make the demo have more of an impact or lend some signaling of industry applicability. just double the delta allowances, no?Even the small Fanuc robot arms cost... well a lot.Let me put it this way, a Fanuc LR Mate with R-J2 Controller costs about 3500 USD in a Used Non-working state, and it's from the late 1980s IIRC.The closest you could get would be a copy of Fanucs RoboGuide software. You would need to contact them about it, but I believe it starts at 1000 USD.Your best hope would be to contact Fanuc directly and see about signing up for some of their classes or find a factory near you with a training robot and beg them to use it (YMMV).For a freebie interactive online course on basic robotics, check out the universal robotics website. Fanuc robots are well built but quite strange to program. (I've done ABB, Kuka, denso, Staubli, and Fanuc programming)Fanuc is also super into DLC, you want a password feature to protect the robot code? 1000$ Ethernet-ip driver for the port that's already in the machine? $2800.Check out abb's robot studio, it's got a 30 day trial with full simulator capabilities.Look for a certificate class at a community college. I did this and have been programming fanucs for about a year now, way cheaper than buying a robot.Are you specifically interested in learning Fanuc stuff (software etc.) or just robots like it in general? (eg non-Fanuc/Generic software)If you want the CNC machines, try the Fanuc Academic NCGuide software. It will cost you a bit but you will essentially gain experience of programming a virtual machine. They also do an educational robotics package but you need the budget of a university for that.You could try asking in RobotforumYou can use any robot as a welding robot, with special welding series optimized in terms of mechanics for welding. It is more convenient to feed wire, the payload capacity is optimized for cost reduction, and there are several other differences.What specifically do you want to weld?I believe it’s mostly software, you could probably get by with the m10 but it won’t have the fancy weld profiles like automatically do the nice loops and stuff. You would need to just weld straight lines or manually program the waves. I would contact Fanuc and see if you could get welding software options for it.I know nothing about Fanuc robots, but you said "ASCII backup". Do you have an older ASCII backup? Maybe you can do a "diff" on the two ascii files and see the changes you're looking for.For future reference, this forum is a great source for industrial robo questions :)ABB has a lot of 3d printing stuff published. The scientist doing it was biao Zhang and JJ Wang. Check their papersdrip feed sounds like an option for fanuc cnc controllers. i only encountered it on an older BWO model where it was an option to run large programs with the tradeoff of not being able to do any branching in the program. if fanuc robots support this, it's probably a paid option.in your case, you may try to split the job into manageable pieces for the controller and to then call them one after the other from a main program.another option would be to write (or look for) a karel program that will allow you to stream the code line by line from a pc through a socket (if you have that option installed). [edit] this is how ROS 1 handled robot control for fanuc, albeit it only supported joint movements [/edit]do you have an old (+10 to 15 years) robot controller?also, you may want to talk to fanuc about the issue. they may be able to offer help.Did you check all axle decoder signals? Could be a position mismatch that blocksDefinitely interested in updates on this!Do you have a Fanuc controller or are you rolling your own? I picked up a Staubli arm in an auction that appears to be in good shape, but no controller. Thinking of turning that into a project, while I'm nice and ignorant of just how much work it'll be.Tried infusing some heat before moving?What happened to it? Was it a serious crash?nice! keep us updated!!But.... But..... Is so CLEAN! what was it doing that it broke???Judging from the pictures of the controller I found online, it seems very similar to the teaching pendant that we have for our FANUC robot in our laboratory. Basically you have four modes of operating the robot in manual mode using the pendant:JointVGRFToolUserWith each of these modes, you use the six blue key pairs to move the robot, but you move different things each time.When in the 'Joint' mode, each of the pairs is moving one of the six joints, independenty.In the 'VGRF' mode, you control the end-effector along the axes of the fixed frame of the robot.In the 'Tool' mode, you control the end-effector along the axes of a frame located at the end-effector itself.In the 'User' mode, you control the end-effector according to a User defined coordinate frame.You can switch between modes by pressing the 'coord' button.I am not sure about all the names of the buttons and modes, as I am basically not in front of the robot right now.Hope this helps!Best bet is to look for a manual. Fanuc can probably provide is directly.Sometimes the tool is in group 2 instead of group 1. Make sure that your coordinates (COORD) is set to group 2.Silly question but is the welding tip still in good shape?Welding tips are in good shapes i change them often. Also the nozzle and diffuser too. Still couldn’t get the hang of itI’d be curious as to how good your welding fixture is that’s holding the parts. Also the quality of the parts impacts the welding path greatly. If the parts aren’t repeatable, you may need options like touch sensing and seam tracking to account for variations between parts.http://fanuc.pennineuk.com/fanuc-6-alarms.htmPRIO-095: P type instruction out of sequence in your code.http://www.robot-forum.com/robotforum/fanuc-robot-forum/alarm-help%28%29/SRVO-371 seems to be caused by faulty power supplyYou can try asking r/plc, I think that group does a lot more work with industrial robot arms. This group typically does not use the oem software tools.A lot of this documentation is provided on the fanuc crc website, most people with these documents most likely will not share them openly on the internet because it violates the crc terms of service and I would prefer to keep access.Sign up for a subscription to the crc and just download everything you want, it will also give you access to phone support which is typically amazing.So you're trying to start the program from an input? You can do this several ways. One is to assign a macro to input that calls your program. You could setup the binary pns system or assign your tp program to run in auto from the program select menu.You'd want to configure your program start type to "other" for that to work.https://www.onerobotics.com/posts/2016/starting-fanuc-robots-in-auto/Fann-ikThese are likely to be used for palletizing operations which are often done by manual labor. They need the reach to create the patterns and as the payload goes up so does the bulk of the robot.What are your reasons for a cobot to do welding? My favorite is Yaskawa/MillerThe cobot is super user friendly and can run more advanced lincoln welding waveformsYou need to get it to stop dropping the box before it gets to the pile.Typical...a bunch of robotics engineers fixing a vacuum. Story of my life.To actually troubleshoot this we would need waaaaay more info- is this a new setup, what have you tested, when did it start, does it occur every time, can you access the internals/view IO's anywhere, based on this clip alone it could be a million thingsCan we get your salary for the day if we figure it out ? :)I bet the vacuum hose gets constricted at certain angles/heights.Looks like you are missing a sponge on one section. The vacuum is not strong enough as it gets out between gaps.Monitor digital output controlling the vacuum just to make sure it's stays on the whole travelAny vacuum detection? Does it give a value? Does it happen randomly?This is an industrial Fanuc r2000ia-200f robot from 2002. It has a payload of 200kg. The controller that I got with it unfortunately had the incorrect firmware. I build a new controller using Odrives and LinuxCNC. The planned use for now is a CNC router/plasma cutter, but that depends on how well I can get the servos tuned and everything zeroed properly.noice! You probably don't need to be told, but I'll tell you anyways: Be careful dude. This kinda robot arm can kill you. An Emergency turn off button isn't optional. You have to get one (hard to tell if you already installed one from the video.)That aside, nice shop!That is super cool what kind of job do you have?Can you recommend any good resources for learning Linux CNC with robot arms, I've never used Linux CNC. I've been using ROS to solve all my kinematics and I want to have option to move away from it.Out of all the videos on this sub I think I've seen just one where they followed proper safety and I'm sure even then those engineers didn't give a fuck outside the presentation setting. I wonder how often these things actually kill people by accident.By coordinates do you mean the joint pose or the Cartesian coordinates? If you're dealing with joint poses you'll have to deal with a whole new set of kinematic/inverse kinematic functions. Other than that the communication protocol including health and exception statuses will be different. It isn't a huge pain, though. It took about 2 weeks for me to adapt our system from UR only to work with Yaskawa arms. Just make sure to take safety precautions when dealing with industrial arms!I guess it depends on how complex your software setup is and what you want to achieve. For the past year now I've been working on making drivers for different robots (fanuc, kuka, abb, some UR) and each one poses different challenges depending on what you want to do. Fanuc uses quite ancient software (afaik) and you basically use bare sockets for communication, so you have to implement some abstraction layer in *ugly* karel language. ABB on the other end of the spectrum has "RWS" interface based on HTTP requests, which is really nice to use, but is also quite slow (but also has "EGM" for "real-time" control). I don't remember Kuka that well now, I think there was good interface for "normal" control, but in our case we needed "real-time" control of joints from a PC and there wasn't really a package for it (or there was, but wasn't really supported).Our company wanted to know exactly what you want and it ended up as a task for two interns (including me) for three months, to research how to control three different robots. In short, depending on your latency/parallel execution/real-time requirements it can be either an easy task for an intern, or a journey for a few months with few mid-level developers (as it is in our case). Outside of basic functionality, each robot will probably have some strange behavior(s) on higher abstraction level that you didn't account for and it will take a week or a month to solve.Also, you can try "renting" the robot for a short period of time, like a month. We did this in our company and it costed way less, while allowing to test the robot.This is what ready robotic's sdk is all about. Code once, and swap arms as necessary. Check it out. They even have free tutorials to help you hit the ground running.Sounds like an auto manufacturer. I work at we ABB, Fanuc and Motoman.I used to work on FANUC robots, but I only poked at that stuff once. I know someone who knows it well but he changed fields. There are a few other engineers I know well that might know it, but I am not certain.If you are extremely desperate I can try getting in contact with them.r/FanucYou can only use Karel if the controller has a valid license for it. If that license is in place you can load the programs from the USB port in the newer pendants.I sympathize with you. Their software and interfaces feel so put of date compared to companies like Kuka. The programs are real fun to debug too. It's basically impossible to log or print out things to try to figure out any math errors. And yeah, the documentation is pretty bad. They do have good performance though for the size range and are decently priced. At least they have that going for them.Do you habe access to FANUC Roboguide?In my opinion, Keyence has the only 3D random bin picking system worth buying right now.I like iRVision on Fanucs for anything 2D, and a lot of 3D, but their bin pick pales in comparison to Keyence's system in both pick rate and identification. And the programming for Keyence is painfully easy, and ports directly into just about every major robot brand.Fanuc helped us set this up using STVS1 and merge3d programs. Creates a user frame by taking two pictures each of 3 targets to established three 3D points and creates a plane from this data. Allows for auto calibration of a fixture surface that pivots and/or shifts slightly.It's annoying as hell that you cannot run iRCalibration VFrameSet in auto-theres no reason you shouldn't be able to, and they even let you run VTCP in auto.To make it work you have to delete a lot of the iRCal-generated code and go digging through the system variables, where you can find a PR which contains the results of the last stereo vision karel subroutine ran. If you add code to copy that into PRs between each call, and then use either MERGE3D2 or custom karel code, you can generate a userframe.The hack job way I just described does have a plus in that you can use it with the other modes MERGE3D2 supports, like two-point, and 4-point which does a best fit of the last two.Is that just a blank ATI tool changer plate on the end?Be prepared. FANUC’s offline programmer ROBOGUIDE is $10,000/year and I personally have not been able to get it to work properly without having to reinstall the whole thing each day that I wish to make a new robot setup. (Got a 30 day free trial and when I asked support about my issues they said that it was a common problem with no known solution).Buying a used classical robot is easy. The more complicated task is to identify used collaborative robots. The Fanuc CRX-10iA was introduced in december 2019 which is 7 months ago. So it is available in the second hand version too. What is not possible is to find used biped robots from Fanuc, because they are not sold in the brand new version, therefor it is not possible to get a discount for a model which has 1000 operational hours in the past.Be prepared for no customer support. If you did not purchase the product from them (with proof of purchase and tons of money), they pretty much wont even talk to you. In my Masters program we acquired a Fanuc 6-axis manipulator from a third party and this was our experience. They essentially told us they don't offer support to non-customers. Ended up getting a Denso instead.we have lots of used Fanuc products.Hi there u/Ok_Refrigerator_8518This post was one of the most popular in the last year.

I know nothing about all this but I want to do much. I want to change my life and learn. I don’t know where to startIn China, there are many small businesses using cheap Chinese-made robotic arms. However, large private companies generally use robotic arms from KUKA, FANUC, etc. The Chinese government is currently promoting the use of Chinese-made industrial robots by state-owned companies.Not sure about welding, a lot depends on the technology you use on site. Cheap robots may give you problems with repeatability or with the source control. Some advanced welding procedures may not be available at all.pick and place should not be an issue, you can compensate with a socket design for positioning.Major part of a cost of a robot are gearboxes, fanuc can last 10 years and keep the repeatability within spec, the cheap ones? I’m not sure.At the same time China is implementing 5x more robots in a year then the whole world combined, the economy of scale should drive the price down.Btw, kuka is a Chinese brand now.Anyway, make sure the robot is allowed to be used in your country first before you buy any and make sure the service is available locally.It's like several things from China. I've had some top quality products that came from China. I've also had absolute junk. There are some new Chinese brands that are really making headway. Generally speaking; you get what you pay for.Would recommend you stick with one of the big three or a refurbished fanuc. Even if mechanically the units are close(they aren't), the software and additional tools that the big brands offer are so much better.Full scope on the J6 there although i wouldn't be able to confirm if that's sufficient weight to overcome the inertia nor how the assigned torque would impact on vulnerable parts. Speed looks good though. And 9.4% load-bearing must count for something.Whether they're good or not isn't the question you should be asking.Whether you can get parts for them, or support, in a timely fashion, is the question one should be concerned with.You may save money up front, but when your money making machine is down for a month, what did you really save?Source: 25 years installing, maintaining and servicing these things, including 2 years at FRNA.Okay lets have a look. Spoiler: not very good english, but I think you will get the point.The r2000 is big and not very precise! But that doesnt really matter.Userframe:You can meassure a userframe with a teaching-tip. I normaly plan my grippers in a way that i have a tap somewhere, and an teaching-tip that I can screwinside this tap. This teaching-tip must be teached in. I´m a bit rusty with fanuc, with kuka you kann do it via the 4-point method. you have your teaching-tip, and another tip somewhere in the room and you put the tip on tip from 4 directions. The robot calculates the TCP from that and that is your teaching-tip. Now you know where in the room the tip of your teaching-tip is. First step done.Your userframe represents something you want to work with, in your case maybe a palett for stacking boxes. The userframe is defined from 3 points.The zeropoint - the point where X 0 Y 0 Z 0 are. In case of an Palett I would use a cornor of the palett oder make and teaching-helper like an sheet of steel with markings that I can always put in the same way on the palett. Then you have the Second Point -> X+ . This point defines the X-direction and the angle A (around Z, its named different for fanuc, but I am not sure how!). And last but not least Y+ -> A Point anywhere on the surface to determinate B and C angle.Now you have a precise user frame. If you want to tune it a little bit -> you can manipulate all user-frames and type in values. so you dont need to teach if youmaybe see you are in X 5mm off.Tool:I am very happy when I get my tool-data from the CAD (and more happy when they are in fact correct!)There are a few methods like the one I described for the teaching-tip to set the tool datas.Misc:You should maybe reduce the max. torque the robot can reach in the programm to reduce the damage by crashes.I am not shure if this is possible (dont know how much payload you have, etc). For example: the standard torque-maxfor kuka robots is 200%. I reduce it in some cases to 10%, and it helps a LOT!Hope it helped you a bit!1600 is around 80k with a 5 meter track to a school.Haha I needed the same information for a similar project a few years back. I set up a "fake" company to get a quote and got caught. The guys at ABB were relentless in asking questions until I just spilt the beans. They never gave me a quote 😂. I ended up using an estimate based off prices people on the internet told me.Ask as a student of your school. Whenever I request quotes, I say I'm an employee of my university.I just throw an RFQ up on alibaba. The Chinese always come in at less than half the price than the people who resell their stuff in the US.I have the prices for the UR3 UR5 and UR10 from universal robots. For the most true price i give it in local currencyUR3: 140.000 dkk (new price from 2017 earlier was 120.000) Ur5: 160.000 UR10: 210.000Kuka have the 7kg iiwa co-bot.

They said these companies have so many private contractors that it's reasonable even with a different email.try calling a used robot supplier. They know the original asking price and the used price.I taught myself how to use a 300i with YouTube videos online. I’m not sure if the pendant is the same but I used links like this one: https://youtu.be/c-PRxCZF4a8Your job should be training you on how to use it's equipment/software's. I worked for a Fanuc integrator for 2 years. First day, I was in their training class learning the teach pendant. Likewise my second job, I went through their robot training and then took a Solidworks course (with an outside company). A good sign of a company is that they want to invest in you and train you properly.It's a fanuc https://www.fanucamerica.com/products/robots/series/lr-mateAre you set on the Fanuc? Universal Robots seem easier to integrate as long as you have some digital out on the mill. No integrator needed.It’s not anywhere near as easy as you want it to be, if it’s done right, and will only be marginal at best if half-assed. There’s a reason people make decent livings setting this stuff up, and it’s not because anyone can do it.You might need some controller settings enabled. It’s pretty easy overall though.If you have the manuals and the patience to read through them it's doable on your own, but frankly will be a pain in the dick. Getting the parameters and m codes for the safety interlocks will likely be the biggest hurdle. We have a robodrill job shop cell and hack our way through new setups based copies/derivations on the original workflow Method set up for us and even so, the effort is only justified on runs of ~500 parts or more.I'm a bot, bleep, bloop.

RoboDK is interesting, but I much prefer VC for the sort of tasks that you are probably going to use it for.It's not cheap to buy, but you can get a 30 day trial.Check out https://robodk.comRoboguide became more useful for me once I started importing the solidworks models into the simulation.I've used V-REP pretty heavily for research projects. It has a remote API support for a number of different languages (e.g. Python, Matlab, C), and well as a ROS interface. It also has a really active forums for help.What about doing it in VR:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtYBanxukjgFANUCs are easier to use and have more options.Find the dvds that came with the fanuc. Those are the best available copies of the manual. Robot forums. Com is a decent resource for questions.Also fanuc is the king of paid dlc optionsFanucs are nice. Not sure what you want to know, though.Are you wanting training or what?I work as a Robotics Engineer at GM, they have mostly Fanuc Robots. I wonder if you've had some industrial experience before?. You can PM for any info.no experience with motoman, so i may not be the most qualified person to answer this.but from what i've seen from cabinets from ABB, KUKA, UR and fanuc, you usually have some sort of industrial PC, servo drives and some more hardware/controllers for the lower level stuff.ABB and KUKA run a combination of windows and VxWorks, while UR runs an RT patched debian linux. fanuc is a bit special in that they use a ton of their own hard- and software. i think motoman may be similar to fanuc.even if you only care about the motors, the cabinets can be interesting for the drives. these don't come cheap. but you may have a hard time actually using these things. from my experience, even the drives are mostly undocumented. the guy at excessive overkill on youtube did some reverse engineering on fanuc: https://www.youtube.com/@ExcessiveOverkill this may be interesting.also, even if you get the robot to run with its controller, it may still be tricky to do anything useful with it. depending on the software options, this may or may not be possible (on fanuc, even loading a text file as a program and then compiling it on the controller is an extra option). depending on what you need, these may be pricey. KUKA charges around 500 bucks for an option, ABB is often in the area of 2.5k.but i believe that yaskawa (motoman) has all the options installed, you "just" need a code to activate them. it's obviously not legal to obtain such codes somewhere on the internet. you do what you want with that information.What generation controller? I may have PDF manuals for the arm and controller.I don't know these systems as well as Fanuc or ABB systems, but other than the servo motors, everything in there will be pretty much specific and purpose built. And if they're like Fanuc motors, they may have proprietary encoders on them.If you can verify functionality, there's nearly always a market for used robot parts, since support typically drops off after 10 years. Teach pendants and pendant cables, in particular.Motoman is the old brand name for Yaskawa. What you have might be a collectors item. Google "Motoman history"Awesome!!!Nice, I hear about Fanuc's now and then, but hadn't seen one till nowReally ? Compared to human pick and place, it's really slow and looks expensivex post from r/Fanucrandom component on a driver board that burns up.disclaimer: i work in research, so our robots don't see much use as compared to a 24/7 industrial scenario.so far, we've only had electronics fail on two out of our six robots. one was a dead mainboard in the controller of a 20+ year old kuka and the other was something similar on a much newer fanuc.mechanically, we haven't had any issues at all so far.Motor controllers and depth perception cameras.Motor controllers fail/blow up usually due to environmental conditions.Depth perception cameras get broken because people don’t care and smash into the robots with other stuff in the environment.Surprised to see just electronic failures here so far.Traditional industrial robots generally have much better reliability than cobots. My previous startup had both kinds and in the three years I was there, we never had any component failures on any of our FANUCs, KUKAs, or ABBs. Meanwhile, all of our URs had at least one joint fail and need a very expensive replacement.https://allyrobotics.com10k$ robot armGears. Harmonic drives are notorious in old Fanunc'sWhat kind of robot are you talking about?Bumpers. lol.Ok, it's strong!I would have been more impressed if it tilted the car sideways, or end for end; or if they had two or three of these beasts passing various cars between each other.Not in 1000 years would I put a SBC running ROS and python on a manufacturing line.A PLC is an overgrown SBC with more hardware robustness verification, and a dated software interface for less technical people on the floor, so there's no real issues with that. Of course you wont chuck a raspberry pi on there, you'd develop some hardware that uses an SBC SoC internally and advertise it as industrial ready after vibration/temperature/etc testing.Python is just an easy language to teach and experiment with, serious robotics companies wouldn't use that for anything but some scripting. It'd be C++. The degree isn't there to teach you software engineering, it's there to teach you robotics which is mechanical/electrical engineering maths and physics.You might not use ROS but I definitely know companies making manufacturing robot systems using ROS that sell to factories, who aren't aware that it's using ROS, they just use the custom user interface supplied to them.There is a running question of how okay ROS is to use in an industrial context. Plenty of companies with many customers do use ROS fine in critical-ish contexts. Lots of companies also don't, they make their own middleware around off the shelf protocols.I think the real problem is that you're trying to learn robotics as an automation engineer and finding out being a robotics engineer is a separate job.Automation engineering doesn't really involve doing any robotics, you're a robot end user not a robotics engineer, and you probably won't benefit from a degree in robotics.I think you have a bit of a wrong general picture. ROS is in most robots not used as the real-time safety-critical Soft-PLC that runs the whole machine and is certified. (even though with the ROS 2 version from Apex.Ai, this would be possible!).You have your standard PLC and automation hardware that takes care of safety.But next to the PLC you have an industrial PC that runs Ubuntu and a version of ROS and takes care of the higher logic and complex planning. You can't run 3d perception on a PLC, so if you want to do robotics (instead of automation), you need to use different tools.For a bin picking application, you add an IPC with a nice big GPU, use ROS to stream images from a camera and use whatever Algorithm you want to get your grasping poses. For path planning, you can MoveIt without having to care about the details. (and the high level stuff is most often in python...)After planning, you pass the path to your PLC (or Fanuc Motion Controller) and let it execute it. (if you want, you can also run a control loop in ROS, but with a real time kernel, ....)If an emergency stop is pressed, your PLC (not ROS!) will take care of safety.So in general: you build a machine with your standard components and add a huge brain with ROS so that you have a robot.There's a whole website for thishttps://rosindustrial.org/I worked for a company that built facilities and put our robots in them. We would also sell those robots to customers.In our facilities, those robots ran on gaming PCs ordered off Amazon because that was the cheapest way to get capable machines with an appropriate graphics card at the time. The code uses C++, not Python, and if the robot goes down it's a hit to revenue, but does not bring the whole facility down. Someone checks on robots going down, but in reality these systems have very high uptime.The facility control code is not using ROS, but has a similar architecture. Written in Rust and, again, running on a gaming PC from Amazon. There is nothing in the facility that has higher uptime, though some things are tied.All that is to say: ROS is not inherently unreliable. The inter-process communication layer is quite robust and I've never narrowed a bug down to it. You can write nodes to be robust to failures of other nodes. And you can write nodes which stand other nodes back up when they go down. None of this is encouraged if you read through ROS example code and you certainly aren't going to see this in academia. You have to work on a serious systems software company to learn how to do this effectively.What feature is missing from python that you need for industrial programming? Python is the most popular language in the world and linux is the most popular OS…ROS is esoteric though and feels like a mess to me.You pose a good question, one I cannot truly answer.I would expect any industrial robot is already locked down to its specific manufacturer software/specifications.Yes you can set up the LR Mate to accept an I/O to call the program. Honestly Fanuc has a very good support system. I would call them and I'm sure they would be happy to walk you through it.https://www.fanucamerica.com/home/fanuc-america-product-support/customer-resource-centerI would call the number instead of using online support. They'll ask you for the F number. If you don't know what that is, they'll help you with that too. Good luck!Are you trying to use the robot to tell the printer to start printing?Menu -->Setup -->Prog SelectIt has IOs just like a PLC, it won’t be hard once you look into it.Try IKBT. https://github.com/uw-biorobotics/IKBTTry FABRIK- it's not a deterministic solver (ie there's more than one solution for a given position), but it converges fast and gives pretty natural & smooth looking results.Try FABRIK- it's not a deterministic solver (ie there's more than one solution for a given position), but it converges fast and gives pretty natural & smooth looking results.Looks identical to universal robots btw, you might have better luck finding those published somewhereHi there, if what you are looking for is a closed analytical solution of all 16 possible joints for a single pose. Here is a fresh 2023 paper that does exactly that https://www.mdpi.com/2218-6581/12/2/36. The source code is not available yet, I asked the people who did the article and they said they will have it ready soon. You can ask them the same if you want. The article is really good and has a lot of "aha" moments.totally jealousFirst of all keep applying for roles. Connect with local networking groups, startup space might be interesting?Start your own projects, contribute to ROS and other open source projects.I say apply for those 5+ exp jobs. Maybe you're the only one that knocks on their door, right? "you can hire me now or you can hire me later when I'm more expensive. your choice."I understand your pain. It might be the Houston market, not you. Go where you're wanted and needed most. That might mean relocating to somewhere like Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, etc - where they have tons of jobs for people with your level of experience and training. Sometimes its as simple as you being willing to migrate to where you are in higher demand. As someone currently working in the industry, you'll get hired quickly by applying to jobs in those states mentioned above. Especially if you can pass a drug test. Much success to you. And keep us posted.Who makes this? /sSeems a little archaic compared to what the bleeding edge is today. The billet example is too trivial, you could do the same thing with traditional computer vision systems.If they're going to tout a 3d structured lighting system, they should use parts with loops or something that are harder to train a standard vision system to recognise.https://www.reddit.com/user/FANUCRoboticshttps://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3FI own a small company called Reasonable Robot Repair, I’ve seen a lot of companies apply robotics, I’ve seen a lot companies develop robotics, invest in them, feature them, waste them, and the best ones aren’t public. They’re private companies and they hold their sauce recipe close to their chest. If you want to invest in a robotics company you need to become part of one. You don’t need to be an electrical or mechanical engineer or marketing wizard or whatever, you need to be passionate and apply yourself. Robots make money. As you know. Robots exponentially increase productivity. Take some time to visualize the intersection where productivity is lacking and automation is barely able to provide a solution. That’s where you invest your personal time (and money if needed). Things like picking fruit or flying planes or building houses; robots kind of do this okay, but they aren’t great at it. Pick one. You’ll do just fine.I feel like Epson's robotics are undervalued. They have a pretty decent lineup of robots that could be put up against the high speed offerings by any other robot company (Fanuc, ABB, Kuka, Omron, Denso, Etc)They also trade with a P/E around 7-8 while everyone else seems to trade at 20-30.Robotics is one of those things that are super flashy. This leads to stocks that are way overvalued or more accurately to say stocks that are not priced to the underlying assets. Meaning the hype surrounding each earning report and news article is more important to the stock price than anything else.Well, I am biased... but you can guess what I'd say, and I do believe it.Locus RoboticsMy 2 cents, any of them that actually are doing something that you think could succeed. Lots of robotics companies are doing cool things, but what would have mass adoption? Cool doesn't pay the bills, actually profiting from the use of the bots and/or selling the bots does. Before I started writing code for robotic control systems I wrote code for trade desks on wall street. I can't tell you how many "cool" tech companies turn into a pump and dump. It all depends on if the profits match the hype. I've worked on the software for a handful of robotics companies, but I only kept the stock I was given in 2 of them. Why? Because they were building robots for internal use at other wings of the company. Selling them to other companies was an after thought. But the bots had a specific direction to solve a real problem and cost/benefit analysis done by the bean counters before we even start on something. We knew the economics of it made sense. I'm sure you were hoping for names of companies, but I'm biased so I won't go there. I will say that I've transitioned my career to a company that's working to automate the fullfilment and delivery of goods that everyone has (yes, i mean has) to buy from one vendor or another. Automating everything about the business saves a ton of money so they can undercut competitors with their retail prices. I believe in that business model, regardless of the company doing it. Heck I took a significant portion of my salary to be paid out in stock. Big risk on a fairly new company, but I believe in it.Universal robotics when they go publicNot AITX 😆, ok probably NVIDIA with their upcoming Jetson products.Here’s a couple of organizations that typically slide under most peoples’ radar but do cutting edge robotics related work:Lincoln Laboratory, Johns Hopkins APL, Draper Laboratory, SRI, Shield AI, Anduril, Leidos, Lunar Outpost, Skydio, Teledyne/FLIR.To answer that question you can look at the list of robotics conferences and check who are the sponsors of said conferences, and which companies regularly have booths there.(top robotics conferences include IROS, ICRA, and RSS)These are the companies invested in robotics and that are looking to hire robotics expertise.Add Universal Robotics and Unitree Robotics to the list.Doosan is a bit smaller but also on the marketJudging from your name I would think you would know Intuitive Robotics at least because of their DaVinci Robot Surgery System.Universal Robots (arms) and Mobile Industrial Robots (AMR) are sister companies, though their HQ is located in DenmarkHow about Amazon robotics?Kuka, Fanuc, and ABB are the big games in industrial/practical robotics.Idk what the obsession over humanoid robots is about. They might be cool, but super impractical and limited.I enjoy watching the precision of a robotic arm, and feel thrilled by the mechatronis behind it. This one reminds me that we should all be looking at been involved in designing and/or programming one. That specially goes to the poor lady that used to sort out those chocolates.While these are working in a pick and place capacity, they aren't quite what wpul d typically be called pick and place; look up delta robots, they have insane pick and place speeds. FANUC's M1 is the first thing that comes to mind, but ABB makes some really good ones as well I think.What is my purpose?R&D phaseI can watch this all day. Sad it is such a short clip...A pair of robotic peckers.this is a challenge to program. the moving conveyor, the shared duty between 2 robots and the gap-fill distribution requires some serious tracking variables and computation. I’m assuming there are probably wrist-mounted cameras involved..?I don't know a lot about robotics but what if I built this using parts from amazon and 3d printed arms component, and got the programming perfect, where would it go horribly wrong?I get that it’s a demo from Kuka, but I would think they would rather have these shown using their benefit - multi dimension.This can be done much quicker, and cheaper, using a gantry system.The way it opens and closes the door is so sexy.This is so coolThis seems incredibly cool, though I have to ask, is this for a demonstration or is this actually the most efficient method of doing this?Are there ever any part quality issues stemming from chips in the vice or something?Did you do the risk assessment?Hi there u/SmashAndCADr/robotics mod here, really like your project, you should consider submitting an application for our first online showcase to share and discuss your work with the community.Best,u/badmanwillis/downloadvideoPrice. They are probably competing on price.Probably fine for new companies or those looking to save cost by pinching pennies. But for established companies who expect their system to be running and get spare parts for the next 30+ years...probably going to want to go with the name brands.Fanuc has been around for 50+ years, ABB for over 30 years. These companies have been and will continue to be around for a long time. There are a ton of people in the industry who know how to program and maintain the robots.If I were investing in a multi-million dollar system with several robots, I'm going to go with the company that has been around for several decades over the upstart.Also, not to mention the security risks by using Chinese manifractured high technology. I'd be concerned with a Party back door that could brick the robot or otherwise cause it to malfunction.I'd wager there's a URDF model for Gazebo.open source Robot Overlord? I don't know your requirements.video of handling prohttp://www.robodk.com/VREP? (http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)This makes me so excited for future surgery.Cool! We use Fanuc robots at our place...they're about 6 years past end of life....still going, but a maintenance nightmare with tons of downtime.Fanuc arms and Leoni harnesses? Good combo. What guns are they?I have Star wars ep II Attack of the clones flah backs rnAm I the only one imagining all the interlocks between robots and plcs.!Man our kuka robots make those look like something from an early 90's movie.The 12 and 22 numbers refer to stall torque in Newton Meters respectively. Here is a link to technical info. Page 111 (PDF Page 124) would be a good starting point I think.Probably Universal Robots, though at times they are prohibitively “easy”. They do have a ROS driver though, I never set it up for ROS at work but it’s still something I’d like to do. They have URCAP api for interfacing your ML program with it.It is a Cobot though, so that could be a dealbreaker if it can’t handle what you need.Epson has scripted text software and a no code environment that works on all their SCARA robots, payload from 1-20kg. The T3 goes for under 8k and the T6 under 10k. You can download the trial software to see if you like it or not, simulator built into it as well.We need more info.Do you pick the element always from the same position?What’s the size of the element, the mass.What is the cycle time.What is the distance from robot, to the element, to the output.Do you have NOK bin.Do you always get the same orientation for the element.zHow do you send signal to the robot.Then, whatnot the budget. What about the safety, do you need safety limits on any of the axis.Do you have any other robots on site?Finding a robot is dependent on all that and more.I set up a Universal Robot (UR10) as an intern with barely any ROS skills (or any skills at all) a few years ago. I tell you, there might be nothing easier than that. Buuuut UR arms can't really carry heavy stuff.In most instances that I’ve seen vision based picking systems, It’s been fanuc. I’ve worked with tons of kuka and they’re very nice, but only really seen them in box loading/palletizing operations with a set pick point. UR is an option that I assume would be cheaper, but it really is dependent on the payload weight, as they can’t handle much at all.Basically, Kuka is worth investigating, UR is an option for picking small objects such as caps, But fanuc seems to work very well in that atmosphere.I used to work for Yaskawa and although I was on the welding application side, my coworkers did a tonne of vision. As mentioned above more info is helpful. I have some UR experience as well and would shy away from them for any real industrial applicationsWhat did you find difficult with Fanuc?What about ufactory xarm 6?Kuka hasn't become more or less popular in the past few years. The big four (yaskawa, kuka, fanuc, ABB) are still basically jockeying for the lead, though yaskawa is t decidedly lagging.Your prof is probably just a fanboyAt least in medtech, Kuka manufactures the only (that I know of) ISO 60601-certified commercially-available arm which takes a lot of regulatory risk out of developing a medical robotic system from the ground up. Seems like every day there’s a new medical robotics startup coming out that uses a Kuka LWR as the base robot with some sort of customized end effector.Kuka released it's lighweight arm 10-15(?) years ago. That was the last time I remember some buzz in the robotics community about a Kuka product. Maybe this is what your professor is referring to?When you get to be older, the "last few years" might really mean the "last few decades".But the Kuka LWR was too expensive to become popular like e.g. the ones from Universial Robots / Franka.Not an expert but I do suppose KUKA still is considered classic "Made in Germany" quality despite the midea acquisition, also KUKA Systems is apparently a great company to work together with in terms of integration of automated processes.Manufactures focus on sales and work from time to time on "advanced" displays for showrooms so people "think" they are advanced. Robotic research and innovation is not happening at those places (is not their business target)FANUC R-2000iC 210FLego Mindstorm NXTCozmo robot. One of the Anki ones, not the Digital Dream Labs’s Cozmo 2.0 scam.Find out what competition the robotics club participates in and get him a kit of parts that uses the same controller. It will let him develop his skills at his own pace at home.BittleVex iq is what I bought for myself (41) and playing it a lot with my Lego fanatic nephew (6) and it’s great! We are working on an autonomous trex robot now! It’s quite expensive though but the replayability is endless compared to other beginner robotics sets and it’s used in stem teaching in USA schools (I’m from The Netherlands in Europe)Maybe try DJI’s S series?Some options I know of:https://www.encoredataproducts.com/edison-educational-robot-kit-set-of-30/https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-mindstorms-ev3-31313W. Grey Walter has been credited with creating the first electronic autonomous robots. Here’s a clip of him with his robot tortoises.http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/idocs/grey-walterBBC.movI would throw in davinci robot for surgeries in thereNikola Tesla's "teleautomatics" research possibly.1976 ASEA (now called ABB) releases the first all electric industrial robot. The ASEA IRB-6 .Previously they were hydraulic.The Golem reference makes no sense. You could talk about automatons of the XVI century as precursors of automation, notably those from Vaucanson and Jaquet-Droz.As previously said in the comments robotics is a combination of many disciplines: perception, cognitive, dynamics, control and human robot interaction.Currently everyone uses ROS which is a very usefull tool but still need a lot of development in order to make the developments of robot more efficient.If you could standardise the tools needed for robotics and create an easy to use GUI it drastically increase the development in robotics as people could focus on creative development.To me, the big things missing are three, in order of relevance: a) adaptive AI, b) cheaper safe actuators, and c) soft sensors to ensure safe interaction in the environment.a) Robot AI is restricted to very simple environments (e.g., RL type of approaches) or/and very brittle (traditional task planning-based control). This limits the applicability of robotic solutions.b) Cheaper safe actuators are needed to ensure robots' and people's safety, especially in learning-based approaches.c) Cheaper soft sensors would allow robots to gracefully fail, as humans do (humans are way less precise than we realise).Education and awareness.I sell robots, and machine vision, and see a lot of low hanging fruit. Stacking boards, pallet moving, doobie rolling, soldering, paint spraying, dipping, screwdriving, etc for robots. Lid detection, visual inspection, detecting absence of paint, calculating bend angles, detecting black grease on fresh metal, etc for cameras.For every cutting edge application that gets attention there are 10 unsexy applications that a 55 year old manager oversees that can be done economically with robots or machine vision. Problem is that the 55 year old manager is wicked smart at keeping his factory going, but doesn't have time to investigate new ways of doing things. They just keep doing what they are comfortable doing, which is exactly what humans do.Once I show them what the technology can do their heads explode and they come up with all sorts of uses. Almost none of them would be considered boundary pushing. The basic knowledge that I give them in an hour long meeting is what's missing. Technology is not the problem.You're basically asking, why don't we automate all the jobs away. Becase wage slaves are cheaper than robots. When that changes, you'll see industrial robots everywhere.Social acceptance.The automatic elevator was invented around 1910 but took decades to catch on. Why? Because people didn't trust them. Similar thing with robotics. We think they will take our jobs, grey goo apocalypse, skynet, ethics, etc.Algorithm wise, perception is the biggest problem. I’ve read Russ Tendrake’s under-actuated robotics and I’m aware that controls is hard, but perception and particularly the perception -> state estimation pipeline is still basically an ill posed problem. Research groups at big companies are still competing for government contracts on really basic perception problems like change detection in satellite imagery. Deep learning segmentation has plateaued. Every company has their own suite of data labeling, storage, and image processing algorithms. This part needs to be solved firstSoftware (AI) is the limiting factor. This is how I am working on that: https://github.com/rand3289/distributArhttps://github.com/rand3289/PerceptionTimeThis is how I am working on making sensors cheap:https://hackaday.io/project/167317-fibergridThis is how I am working on making actuators cheap: https://hackaday.io/project/171924-braker-one-robotRobots are already cheaper than the human they replace. The big issue with robot arms at least is the terrible UI and lack of software tools, which makes basic programming far more difficult and time consuming than it has any reason to be. AI is not needed or desired for the vast majority of production automation, and instead simple reprogrammability is what is needed for low volume, high mix applicationsI'd look into buying a refurbished robot from a reputable company. You should be able to get, for example, an ABB IRB 2600 (has a capacity of 12kg/25 pounds) for a price that is within even the budget you have for a self built one.Industrial robotic FuSa engineer here,First not matter what you do, you need to certify for ISO10218-2 and ISO13849-1 either on the IMS or the robotic cell. If you don't, you are liable for injuries, maim or death...You have 2 type of Robots:Industrial non - collaborative : Your run-out-of -the-mill-robot you see on car production line. Those are hard to program and requires a good deal of knowledge to use them. They can only operate inside a robotic cell and need to be certified (see ISO 10218-2)Cobots : UR5, UR10, Doosan, Omron TM5, ABB GoFa. Are designed to work alongside human with no barriers, but with protective stops system (light barriers, safety lidar, etc) they can detect collision. They are including a PLC and a Safety PLC. It is designed to be "easy " to use and certify.I hope it help in your decision. Talking to an integrator or a company like PLIZ might give you more insight.Really need more information about application, workspace, payload etc for the industrial robot. The brands you list are all reputable though.Depending on application, I might be tempted to look at cobots, as they're probably a little easier to make safe if you have less experience. Please don't underestimate how dangerous robots can be.As for the hobby machine, have a look at the Haddington Dynamics Dexter.I don't know why, but I'm seeing a lot of universal robotics arms nowadays.Usually someone just tells me: " you will use this", so I don't have any experience choosing. But if I were to, I'd probably go with something popular (like a kuka or an ur)can you get documentation on the servo drivers and encoders? if yes, it'll still be a lot of work, but you can get there by outsourcing all the controller part on a standard PC. look into ROS or coppeliasim for the controller part.if you can't get documentation, you'll have to reverse engineer the drivers, which may be tricky.what brand is it?I did this.First figure out if you can find the wire schema wherever it hooks up to the robot, which wires do what. Without that it would be very hard.Then get appropriate motor controller boards. Create PCBs for them. Get a power supply. Wire these up. Wire controller boards to a pc. Use pc to control robot (I used simulink).Most importantly: build an emergency stop button! Big red button that is in the power loop and disconnects power when pressed. Or you’re going to break things or worse when you try to control it.I would start by trying to troubleshoot it. Do a detail inspection of the robot, and identify where the problem is. If the problem is obvious see if you can fix it.Otherwise, I would recommend that you do not attempt this unless you are given an appropriate budget/time to fix the problem. It will likely end up costing the company more money with your time, then if they went ahead and bought a used robot off eBay.Assuming that you got profitability is not a factor here, I would use a PC running on TwinCAT. I would get 6 Beckhoff servo drives and connect each motor from the robot to the drives. TwinCAT has function blocks for kinematics, which would make the development of a project like this feasible for a single person. But by the time you purchase all the parts needed, you might as well have purchased a used robot.Do you have any ideas as to what the initial issues with the controller were? Also what is the model of robot/controller initially being used? I work with OTC robots pretty extensively. If it’s an old robot you might have more luck looking for Naichi parts online as opposed to Daihen.Let me know if you need any help digging deeper into things.My first question is it running large servos, dc motor or steeper motor. Second question is what is the voltage for the motors?If your hitting stuff then go slower. Also make sure collision detection is enabled and you might need to adjust the sensitivity.Safety first, always be aware of where you are in relation to the robot. You should never be in a position where the robot can hit you unless you are in teach mode and have control of the robot.Edit: For upside down robots make sure you have it configured as a ceiling mount robot. This may be your the reason your having trouble due to the coordinate system being upside down.The robot should be sturdy enough and have enough safety measures to not damage itself.In my field its rather the worry what the robot will destroy.Machine door at round about 1000€, machine head starting at 10.000€, products at the high end at 100k€, machines from 100k€ to half a million.And above that human damage, which should be impossible because of safety walls/cages/zones. That is also the case for you, right?So the question is:Why are you running a freely moving robot at high speeds?Would preprogrammed waypoints help you/be enough?Do you need additional safety features, like i could imagine a light barrier along the segments of the arm? Capacity sensing? Cutof as soon as the motors strain?You can also set parameters to were it won’t be able to hit the solid objectsThe top most priority when working with robots is to not endanger yourself.With that out of the way, a robot that crashes almost always has to be recalibrated, and might perform less accurately in the future. In any case, a robot that collides with something runs the risk of you losing both time and money.I work at a university, and if a student crashes a robot (which many do), it costs a lot to fix, and all the planned experiments are halted. This is why we have simulation software and security systems in place to minimize the risks.So, solutions: If the objects you're colliding with are static, you can add boundaries to your robot's workspace, making it impossible to collide with them. You can also run simulations beforehand to make sure that it does not collide. If the objects are located at different positions every time you run, you should run the program in very slow speeds, so you can stop the program if you see that it will collide, or at least if it collides, it causes minimum amount of damage. You can also add proximity sensors which stop or slow the robot when it comes near an object, or a break sensor at the wrist, so that if the end-effector collides with something, the wrist breaks off, which absorbs the impact and stops the robot. If the objects are moving, then your in deep waters. You would then have to find a way to track all the objects and adjust the robot's movement accordingly. Depending on their movement and many other factors, you might need vision systems, optical trackers or something similar.Maybe program the robot in a simulation environment first if that is possible.Some robot controllers come with a really useful program called Cubic-s. Something to look into if you’re having issues with users crashing the robots a lot.You could use code and algorythims to make sure your robot doesn't crash!Hi! A Robot hitting a person or object could be an extremely dangerous situation. You should definitely make sure you are using collision detection or dual check safety software. In edition, slowing down your speed could really help.If you are in a position that makes you feel uncomfortable asking coworkers how they keep this problem from happening. We offer a free support line that you can call for help.740-251-4312 ext 122 and one of our technicians can help you figure out the problem!I've bumped a few robots into other robots or fixtures. Usually their collision detection is pretty solid and nothing bad has happened to the robots.Having work and safe areas set in helps prevent loads of collisions, always manually run your boys patching many times increasing speeds. If you are running them on auto you can turn down their speed so you have time to stop them too.Often my biggest concern is damaging the end effector, custom fingers / pneumatic cylinders are quite expensive to replace.Run at slow speeds and execute line by line when you're testing your positions.You're probably looking between $30K and $40K. I buy a lot more FANUC's so I don't have recent Kuka pricing, but that is where a robot with that type of payload typically falls.Have you check out the used market?Hit Craigslist. Believe it or not you can get 'em for pretty reasonable money on the used market.For instance: https://detroit.craigslist.org/okl/hvo/6015815740.htmlI know you're not looking for integration costs, but I hope that doesn't mean you think they're trivial. Integration can easily cost more than the bot. Tooling for the arm, tooling to feed and receive parts for the arm, safety enclosure, controls to coordinate with whatever else is there. Just keep that in mind.Looks good. What software is this? Will you be posting your work to github?Why not just use ROS?That’s a pretty big velocity excursion on joint 4 toward the end of the trajectory. It would be interesting to see if the robot could actually execute that in real life.Ever do anything with a fanuc robot?Which article/book are you following? I am doing something similar from 0 with a delta robot. Also, does the use of the 3d files in processing takes a lot of cpu power?Please post when you publish on GitHub! Would like to see the code.I've generally seen twitch due to power problems, not really programming. If the power fluctuates at all (dips too much) you can see wonkiness like this. Try one servo at a time and see if it happens. If not, then you are drawing too much power initially with both connected. I hope you are using a servo controller and not connecting these both to the arduino directly - it doesn't have the power to push two servos (and probably not even one of this size).Im using bench power supply at the moment, voltage controled, while doing testing. Then i will hook up battery pack.I don’t think it will be a problem when you screw the servos to somethingIs this something where you would need a fly back diode? I am not super familiar with circuits yet but I remember reading something in regard to fly back when a controller is switched off.I highly recommend using bus servos for robotics instead of RC servos. Bus servos never jitter, have precise positioning, and can give feedback on power usage and actual position. Some types are available for under $20 and require much less wiring and no extra board to create the PWM.How do you have them hooked up? Straight to pins on the Arduino? If you're not using a servo controller I strongly recommend getting a pca9685. They're dirt cheap and will save you a lot of headaches.The signal is straight from pins on arduino but power is seperate from power supply. They are controlled with Serial communication.Maybe it's just about to fall asleepYou need more amperes from external powersupplyLooks like a fanuc rj2 s420!!Now THIS is the kinda top quality content I signed up for.Worth the watch to see the work put in.This had me in suspense!!!I call shenanigans! The pieces of chocolate switch position while the arm is grabbing the top piece of the cracker.Best use of heavy machinery ever.First you take the mallowwhat exactly is a smore? we dont have them here in the UK?is it just an ice cream sandwitch. is this a good example of a smore?Pair a suitably sized BLDC with an encoder and a FOC controller like the ODriveWhat you are looking for at this scale is sometimes called a 'joint module'. They integrate a motor, driver, gearbox, bearings, and housing into one unit. They are often used on things like robot dogs or cobot arms, and are readily available in torques from 1-100 nm. Expect to control them over some kind of serial bus (CAN, modbus, rs485, etc) and supply them with high current DC in the range of 24-72 volts.'tonifishi' is an OK balance of cost and quality, but expect to pay $300 for 6nm rated torque (continuous duty cycle, at rated speed. Not stall torque). 'good' robot arms for a 1kg payload made in moderate volumes in a Chinese factory cost several thousand dollars, and it is unlikely you can match the quality while beating the price because the configuration is so standard.If this is an educational thing and budget is limited then I recommend scaling down the scope of the project (reach and payload) until you can use 'bus servos' (like dynamixel knockoffs) to achieve your educational goals (kinematics etc). The waveshare bus servos are under $100 and allow you to set not just velocity, but also acceleration parameters and control loop parameters (gains) as you see fit.I hope this helps!I geared down a nema17 1:20 and got about 5nm of torqueI suggest starting with stepper motorsArm specs are: 60 cm at full extension, and 1kg load which would give around 6Nm required at the base.That's assuming a weightless arm, so I'd presume you need at least double what you're specifying.Top-down and bottom-up design strategies are specific to your requirements. Since it appears that you know the exact items you intend on manipulating, and their mass, center of mass, etc, then top-down is probably the best approach.As far as motors go, there are tons of options out there. The ClearPath line of integrated servos are a great value. Pair with a gearbox to reach the desired max torque.Oriental Motors has servos with gearboxes. They are not too expensive for industrial quality.Multiturn — no problem.  For your goal i would recommend hollowshaft frameless DDR coupled a reducer. This will give a decent torque feedback.   Try Chieftec, Kohlmorgen, or Thingap.  Then go and cherry pick your bearings and encoders. Moog is too expensiveSounds like you need a motor that can handle the torque like a gym rat on leg day! 💪That doesn't look dangerous at all!Thanks for the cross post :)Good thing it wasn't a Fanuc arm, they would have had a fit.What Miranda is this? I can’t read the writing on the side. It looks similar to the ABBs we have at work, but they are the newer models that are off white. But I know the older ones were a color like this.finally.a real game chair for playing call of duty modern warefareHas potential to be a very expensive VR gaming chair.It would be good for any game that has the premise of operating a vehicle while sitting.Not ignoring how much work would have to go into making it safe.Cool! Did you get this via their Kickstarter? What was the price?Cool. This is one of the few robotic arms I've seen on kickstarter that actually has usable specs.Ticks a lot of the boxes for practical applications.I am in the market for a robot arm...do you know if you can still buy a unit?nice! im looking for a small robot are for my film studio, i want to create motion control movements for my camera for product shots... do you think this unit could be smooth enough for this kind of work? payload for the price is amazing.I highly recommend contacting Fanuc for help directly. They have some good applications engineers that can answer just about any question you may have.This is simply inverse kinematics, look up how to use frame transformations or dh parameters (I recommend frame transformations), derive the forward kinematics of your system, then invert to get the inverse kinematics. You should wind up with a matrix that when you mulitiply it by your desired output post, it will result in a matrix of the joint angles.Basically, you want the inverse kinematics. To do that, you need the forward kinematics. Nowadays, the forward kinematics of an arm are described in a URDF file. There are libraries out there (KDL,ikrac) which take a URDF file, the names of the base and end effector links, and desired the position and orientation. It then should spit out the appropriate joint angles.There is also the jaocibian method. If your DOF are nice, you can solve the IK symbolically on something like MATLAB as well.Robotics sw engineer for a defense r&d firm in north east us I make 110k 4 years experience with bs in eceWhat kind of controls work are you doing? That seems low, but I have noticed there is a big pay difference between factory automation work and robotics / hardcore control theory work.I bailed from my PhD with an ms in mech e with a specialty in control theory w/ a starting salary of 80k in the midwest. Moved to the west coast working at a robotics startup for 4 years and then back to the midwest as a research scientist making 115k at an aerospace research lab (w/ ~4 years experience). I know a decent number of people in California around the 200k mark working as robotics specialists. The principal engineers at the research lab I was at in the midwest were making just shy of 200k.Ceo is probably both the highest and lowest. Start ups often don't take profit so the CEO gets nothing.The person who owns the means of production.easy.the highest paying job in the field of automation and robotics belongs to jeff bezos of amazonApply to Tesla and Lucid MotorsI strongly endorse XArm 6: https://www.xarm.cc/. We used them in our lab and also ran hundreds of hours of endurance testing.For $8k, one gets a collaborative 6-axis robot made from carbon fiber and harmonic drive gears. Reach is about 700mm, and it can lift 5kg.Programming is easier than even Universal Robots, let alone any of the traditional kind (Fanuc, Kuka, etc). The primary way is Python, but lower-level controls are also available.Nothing great to share unfortunately— i think this guy is what you want but it’s still $15k(!). https://www.mecademic.com/products/Meca500-small-robot-armCheck out https://www.hdrobotic.com/I looked into this a while back and ultimately decided on the AR2. The closest alternative I found was the BCN3D Moveo, which looks like a fairly capable machine, but specifics like repeatability etc. were not listed, and more importantly, there does not appear to be any continuing support. The bill of materials was a long list of parts with no links from three years ago. I don't have time for that!The AR is really a fantastic project. Chris Annin just released a whole new version a few weeks ago (AR3, with backwards compatibility to the previous version) that includes substantial improvements like closed loop stepper control.I've been working in a university lab using the AR2 for a research project for the past year, so I'd be glad to answer any questions you have about it.Depends what your standard of expensive is I guess haha. UARM sells some good ones from my experience, but might be a little priceyCheck out u/centauri24 for his high quality DIY robot arm - the designs are for sale. Iirc the designs are €100, the bom comes to €1000 but you could cheap out on some componentsSixi, made by me @ marginallyclever.com. Open source and hardware.not sure what you mean by "calibrate" but...- you set vertical alignment and the piece is not aligned? check the robot base, it might be lifting- you teach a particular pose and the robot does not return back to the same pose? contact the manufacturer, this shouldn't happen.Have you setup the end effector weight and ran the tuning program? Has your tool centre point been setup? If by calibrate you mean you are mastering, it’s rarely exactly correct afterwards as the scribe marks/master indicator stickers are fairly crude, programs will generally need a touch up afterwardsiRobot, Ekso Bionics, Kuka, ABB just a few I can think on top of my headalso FANUC. caution about investing in some of these small caps. individual companies can be risky you may do better to look for an index fund. also you may do better to invest in suppliers. for example, the chipmaker whose chips are being used rather than the company using them.http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/tech-specs/5 lb / 2.2 kgIt specifies maximum payload on the tech specs.

You can't return it? You didn't check how much it could lift before buying it? Also I don't think that reddit is the best place to sell your shit.It’s a Fanuc arm. They built a few peripherals, developed end of arm tooling, integrated a vision system and called this entire system as ‘Amazon sparrow’.I agree to a certain extent but also think there's a political/hype/PR aspect to getting funding for certain dynamic robotics projects that's pretty important.We're not going to get to human-like control abilities for general-purpose robotics (humanoid or not) by being completely utilitarian.There's also something to be said for a bipedal legged form in terms of being tall and agile and fitting into horizontally narrow human spaces as necessary.A Cassie or Digit feels more like the right path to me than something like Atlas that's shaped a bit like a barrel-chested comic-book hero, but I think a lot of the research overlaps."for the time being our efforts should be better spent on more meaningful robots that have a direct impact on us"I think we do, though. Kuka is like $3bn in annual revenue. Looks like Fanuc is $7bn.Major industrial robot manufacturers are the other extreme from research bipeds: they sell lots of aggressively utilitarian machines that do all kinds of things humans can't do.There's a whole world in between that absolutely is more ripe for short and medium-term private investment than humanoids.Humanoids get a lot of hype and media attention because they're exactly the sci-fi vision of a robot.But they're hardly the main thing going on in robotics.It depends, if the challenge was solved or not. Suppose we are in the early 1990s and it is not clear how to program a robot so that it will climb stairs. Then it makes sense to give the project a high priority to either solve the challenge or proof that it is not possible to build such a walking machine. In the year 2020 the situation looks very different. It was shown many times, that walking robots can be realized, and starting a project which is repeating the same ideas again won't improve the situation.An interesting sub problem is if commercial available biped robots are useful or not. On the first look they are because such a robot can clean up the room or deliver the post. On the other hand, the demand for such technology is low. Even normal automation for example a fully automated supermarket checkout is not requested by the economy. Such a product was realized some years ago, but it was never adapted to the reality. the chance is high, that bipedal robots sold by a robotics company won't find customers too.Your idea that "we need robots to do something humans can't" is something I disagree with, and your next line about sorting a bunch of cupcakes proves my point. We absolutely need robots that can do things humans can do. But, they need to do them faster, cheaper, and in harsher environments. Humans can sort cupcakes, but robots can do it faster and cheaper.Also, you have a pretty fundamental misunderstanding. When we design robots to handle harsh terrain, the best designs tend to look like high-dof "legs" that are adaptable and applicable to any number of different environmental factors. It just so happens that humans evolved with similar methods of walking so that we too could traverse lots of varieties of terrain. Bipedal robots aren't designed to look like humans, they're designed to go anywhere a human can and more.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect the statement as such - opinion. In my opinion there is a clear usefulness for non humanoid robots for use in manufacturing and distribution and such at this time. This in no way makes the desire to have humanoid robots "a waste of time", humanoid robots in fact would have distinct advantages over their purpose built industrial counterparts. Lets look at an existing manufacturing environment for one, a custom bot who is designed to do a certain task can replace a human operated machine but a humanoid bot can simply run the existing machine. And naturally that humanoid bot created in the human form factor can also operate any other machine made to be operated by humans. So now lets look at the big picture based on humanoid operations of machines made to accommodate humans for a second..... .... a non humanoid bot can be installed in a plant to perform a specific task, but a single humanoid bot can walk casually into that plant and do all of the manufacturing, office related paperwork and billing, all of the packaging and even hop into the drivers seat of the truck in the loading dock and drive the product to it's destination. This is just one facet on the jewel of the humanoid robot dream when we think that our entire world is engineered to accommodate the form factor. Naturally mankind isn't technologically advanced enough to realize a true humanoid bot, but that in no way means working toward the endeavor is a "waste of time".It is nice to have a controversial discussion on this topic - indeed we have the same discussion in our institute from time to time.I mostly agree with u/hingler36You have to differentiate two points:are we talking of short term or long term commercial application?are we talking of commercial application or basic research?For short term commercial use, bipeds are a niche and probably not worth to invest money.For long term, biped locomotion offerstraversability of rough teraingeneral purpose adaptation to human environmentsresearch suggests that copying this spring loaded walking mechanism from nature can allow an EXTREMLY efficient way of locomotion (in terms of energy consumption)Means this is defenitely worth a shot, even thouh the every day life applications are 20 something years awaySilly boy, the whole goal of bipedal robots is to make sexbots. Everyone knows that but you can't just go ask your boss for money to make a sexbotMuch of varying groups out there would push for the development of certain robotics-android-bipedial-like research, and it already exists. This obviously includes Boston Dynamics bipedal robots, along with DARPA, but turns out that it takes actually robotics that are just built without these types of bipedals are actually not as agile. So to the OP here, you are actually not correct. Apparently it takes a considerable amount of agility for robots to be able to move on all terrain type that is not granted without this.However there are many groups that would push for such with robotics to be human-like. Certain groups like the military (DARPA is known for it) and other consumer groups would like such.Hopefully you get that dream of the bipedal future, and others. For instance that sort of promise is something that's been promised to robotics, just like the dream of AGI has been the dream of the AI communities.What do you mean anti-fraud reasons for Robot Studio? It’s free for students.3d printed what?Why is this better than using an off the shelf arm and adding your own software?  Buying the milk is easier than raising a cow. Does anyone work with a commercial robot arm that might have input about the application of this for camera work?Older industrial robots don't need new software, they need mechanical overhauls, specifically gearboxes/grease and internal wire harnesses and the parts alone can add up to half the cost of replacing the controller and mechanical unit.In the scheme of things and value they can provide, the cost of a brand new arm/controller is pretty fucking reasonable.Hi there u/ganacbicnio,This is really impressive stuff, I'm sure the community would love to know more about it.You should consider applying for the 3rd annual Reddit Robotics Showcase! An online event for robotics enthusiasts of any age and ability to share their projects!Announcement PostWebsiteThat's quite an accomplishment. Kudos.That’s some really impressive build quality—looks professionally designed and built.Weirdly, it appears wee bit reminiscent of one IronMan’s detachable arms, despite the color scheme differences.Please share more details! Is this a six axis? What was the cost? It looks like a FANUC LR Mate. Very cool.Looks sick!Please Post details.I would very much like to see your documentation.Thats kinda a big question. Are you looking to start a whole assembly line or is this more of a "in the garage" type project?I may be wrong, but usually welding is done in an assembly line type process or in cells, where you have designated welding bots, and the parts come down the line, sometimes put in place by other robots. Overall a pretty extensive project. Are you looking for tips to start from scratch? Or looking for robot suggestions? Or just looking for welding end tools?If you're starting from scratch, you can't do this. Well, you can, but you'll have to go to school to study welding and robotics. We can't help you here.Depending on how “official” this is, and how skilled you are at setting up robotics systems, you could probably get started at around $10-20k if you’re really on a budget. Or have an integrator come in and do it for way more. You need 3 basic things, the fixture, which holds all the separate pieces in place. the welder, which would be a MIG welder with an external start/stop input. And the robot, most commonly used welding robots are Fanuc Arcmate ones. Depending on the condition they can range from $2-20k for used ones. Then you have to program it all so it works correctly and set up light curtains and or a cage around the entire thing for safety.To borrow from an art mentor, you need a product, not a project.You have prototypes? So you need to either hire an industrial designer or learn design yourself so you can make a finished, professional looking product. Just a single one.You need to think of manufacturing, marketing and funding. Who's this product for? Do you have the ability to manufacture these by yourself? At what capacity? How much will your product cost? Do you need additional funding to start manufacturing?I'll echo the other user and say, what exactly is it you want to do? Sell an actual mass-produced product? That is an enormous undertaking that usually involves having parts made by some Asian manufacturer, having your product certified to comply with regulations etc etc.What might be a lot easier is to sell kits for a robot. I could imagine being able to entirely circumvent all those regulations since you'd effectively be reselling already certified parts.Rather than trying to make 'a roomba' have you considered doing bespoke projects for a client?This takes the pressure of you to figure out a market- the client does that, you just get to focus on what you presumably enjoy, designing and building robots to help with whatever problem the client comes to you with.There are lots of companies around who will design some bespoke robotic system to perform a specific task for a client- often in more of a R&D capacity, where they'll provide a working prototype, for the client to then go and take to market on a larger scale.Most of these companies work with industrial production lines, as that's where robots are used- but more are appearing who do stuff in the mobile robots market.But before all this you need an problem to solve(idea).I tend to use sticky tape and zip ties.Maybe you should contact someone on on fiverr, to get the idea of how people do things professionally. you can spend a few bucks to:design pcb, which you can order online (extremely inexpensive)pay a few artists to sketch a product idea. Just to get their design concept. Pay 2-3 people at once, it's cheapget 3d cad designsany software or GUI or some random tool.Communicating with these guys and explaining them your needs, you'll learn faster and more relevant stuff. I don't think you can use fiverr to launch a final product but it can be faster for prototyping (you get what you pay for). Use it for simple stuff.IMO you should not design your own pcb if you don't do it professionally; Pay someone $10-20. It's not practical to spend time learning PCB design for a software guy. But if you have time, sure ! same goes for many other things.If you have a bigger budget go to Upwork.Since you already have the design file and prototype made, the next step would be to find a manufacturer and to get proper funding for your project.1. Funding would probably come first because you can't do anything without money. The book methods would be to showcase the prototype to potential investors, but crowdfunding has become a very popular choice. There are Kickstarter/crowdfunding marketing companies that will help you market your product and they just charge a percentage of the money your campaign makes (odds are that they'll get you a lot more backers than you would get if you do it yourself)2. Finding the right manufacturer is extremely important. Just because you have the funds from investors doesn't mean you should blow it on any manufacturer. Things to look out for are:- Quality - How much do they care about details? Are they sourcing the best components? Are they able to deliver your product even better than how you want it?- Speed/efficiency - Can they produce your quantity how you want it and as fast as you want it? If not, you'll just be back-ordered watching your potential clients move on.- Cost - If the manufacturer is able to fulfill your quality and efficiency needs AND offer you a low cost, that will be KEY.3.

If so you can take a look at dramatHave a look in to RoboDK - to get accurate simulation results in your application you might need to calibrate your robot. Have a look on their website they have a lot of detail about their options and a blogI make robots that swim inside the human body. It's extremely fun, and I believe that it's the beginning of a new market category.What I think will be the most in-demand will be AI/ML research engineers.Being able to collect accurate demonstrations and data for your environment/robot and how to exploit sub-optimal demonstrations for training/fine-tuningBridging the gap between VLMs and robotic control (currently we have VLMs output sentence-actions to robotic control policies), one big challenge is open vocabulary control (even the best language-visual-action models are limited to the action-verbs found in their demonstrations)Two branches will appear: robots that have a stable access to supercomputers and will be able to run MoE VLMs for their control at 10+Hz, and robots that have autonomy and run super-optimized models on edge on super-efficient hardwareWill still need a lot of hand wiring for all the software so R&D engineers will be in demand.There seems to be so much to be gained with existing tech.

Because what Ukraine is able to do with them is upending military doctrine.I'm interested in seeing how others answer this. Fanuc is a great opportunity but it would pigeon hole you into a very specific system but vision is becoming more and more important. I work in the metrology field in tech support and vision based acceptance of parts is becoming larger especially with batteries. I feel the python / C# programming would really help you long term ad it would keep you open to future changes. But idk again I am interested in seeing how others answer.Fanuc software is for fanuc and similar industry systems. I doubt they will use other open source tools (ros, move-it, orocos?). If you want to be in that line of work that's a good place to be. The software probably won't translate to other industries. My guess is you will be using the software, not designing/programming it. If you want to be an industrial robot arm person I'd choose that.C# and python I'm guessing you're doing Unity integration? This is what some of the more r and d type work is moving towards. There are lots of other opportunities if you have these skills, and it will open other doors not necessarily limited to industrial robotic arms. I would love an ME who can program...I basically program all the MEs stuff for them after they set up the kinematics / dynamics.It's where the money is now. You can develop.an app for next to nothing and make money.Robotics is a combination of mechanical, hardware, and software. Some applications are mature, but autonomy, dexterity, flexibility, and agility need more work, and thus more money."I wonder if people fail to see that or I fail to see issues internal to the field"I think one technical thing that really strikes me since I've been working in robotics is how good human beings are at physics-enabled long-term predictive motor control with complex contact forces.I notice it all the time now. I got a glass container out of the cupboard last night for the leftover pasta and took the third one down in a stack, letting the top two down in a controlled drop.I screwed up and toppled a nearby stack of smaller containers that I caught while it was still a curved stack and pushed it back upright and into place.Then I think about trying to do a demo of that one stupid cupboard with a robot. 😭 It's probably possible, but it would just be a demo, and wouldn't necessarily generalize to putting the Parmesan back in the fridge without knocking anything on the floor.And I used to work in soft robotics so don't get me started on folding and putting away the laundry 😂We're so, so incredibly good at this kind of real-time planning around how objects are going to move when we touch them. Computational advances, good physics engines, control theory, etc are all working toward solving this, but it's really hard."What I don't understand is why robotics is still not prevalent"Robots are prevalent in structured tasks in well-capitalized industry. Also where the hard part is navigation like tractors and ships. 3D surveying and autonomous navigation is getting there especially with drones that can freely move in complex environments.To me, the place it feels like robots are notably missing compared to sci-fi is human-like-robots in homes, small businesses, out on the street delivering packages. IMO it's because most of the tasks there require a combination of real-world-practical robot skill and "labor" cost savings that simply doesn't reach human levels yet.With massive respect to the research work involved to get here, state-of-the-art commercially-deployed perception, manipulation, and mimicry for unstructured tasks seems to be something like a very strong toddler who never gets bored.That has huge economic potential for things like bin picking but still doesn't compete well against $3-$15/hr adult humans in lots of roles that require finer motor control or lots of task switching. You still need to program the robot to do things, it still is on the "simpler" end of skills, and if you don't have a full-time employee doing that thing, the economics won't work out.I also think small businesses and homes tend to be undercapitalized so up-front costs to save long-term costs are not always possible or desired.If the cost structure is "$250k up front" that will end up at $2.50/hr over the robot's lifetime, it's still enough to discourage a lot of entities that will pay $7.25/hr forever for the same work.Business in robotics is hard, because robots are not as useful as you’d think currently.Autonomous robots cannot barely do any task with enough performance to justify its development. The successful robotics companies are the ones that could find the niche use case where a robot is actually useful, only very few.Classic automation is the only means to scale manufacturing beyond the speed and reliability humans hands can achieve, while robots are automation tools they are too clumsy and slow compared to humans.There are very few things robots can do better than human driven machines. One of them is repeatability, another is traversing hazardous environment without risk of harming a human, another is to operate relentlessly as long it has power.By definition a thermostat control on a furnace is a 'robot'They have been very successfully used for a very long time.Complexity of robots of the types you list is magnitude greater.The systems have to be virtually foolproof and requiring spit second adequate reaction to ALL endcases of their situations. That is a tall order. Double the complexity and quadruple the number of things that may go wrong (and need to be handled)Because capitalism.I want to learn programing industrial robotic arms like FANUC arm, etc. Where or How can I do that ?That is very interesting, I’ve been working on getting a Fanuc r2000ia-200f running with a retrofitted controller. I used LinuxCNC to hand all the gcode/kinematics/encoders, and Odrives to run the motors(full power amps were way to expensive), the project is like 90% complete, there’s still some encoder bugs to work out and safety stuff to setup.What did the encoder protocol end up being? Fanuc has their own as well and it’s 2.7Mbit/s rs485, it took quite a while to figure out.super cool. I have a scara with the 310 controller but have problems getting to work.Thats a beauty! I noticed your a michigan resident, do you work for a company in automation alley?What are you palletizing??Is there a pad under that monster? How thick is that slab?Is it going to be used for stacking & packing pancakes?You should have put a banana on the ladder.I'm analyzing this pic and I have two requests, can I see a pic of the other side (looking for the other servos) and can you apologize to the facilities guy for anchoring this right over the drainage channel? tiaMentors from my days in FIRST roboticsSolve a problem. Say on resume "Am Engineer". When asked if like robots, say "yes".Helps to be engineer. Judging from my coworkers, this step is optional.I took all robotics related courses (AI, Advanced Algorithms, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, etc) in college and grad school that I could. My BS is in Comp. Sci., and I have two MS degrees in Comp. Sci. and Electrical & Computer Engineering. You should should look for robotics jobs funded by Gov't contractors, the Gov't, or Google.FIRST Robotics throughout high school, then a robotics degree program in college with a bunch of robot related extracurricular and research in undergrad.Mechanical engineer, did my masters thesis on series elastic actuators for humanoid robots and built numerous successful humanoids in our lab. I got my job in robotics and attribute it entirely to connections I made at Conferences.Doing personal projects about robotics, joining a robotics student association and doing more projects. Then joining an internship to program a robot for Robocup@Home contest while on a robotics master. Eventually go from intern to employee to guy-who-plays-with-all-the-robots. I guess finally ???? and profit.Took extra upper-division engineering classes all focused on sensors, control systems, and electromechanical design (motors/controllers/programming)Pro school is an amazing time to load up on specialized classes. A lot of ppl I knew took the minimum number of upper division electives to graduate. I took 2x the number and it is the reason I have breadth as an electromechanical/materials engineer. Sure I graduated a year later than my class... but I got out before the master's track folks and am (IMO) far better educated.As for how to get into the industry? I got a job as a test tech doing stuff from programming big DENSO robots to building custom widgets and gizmos to stretch twist pull whatever. A year of that on my resume and some references saying I could design, build, or program just about anything pretty much sealed the deal.I was contacted by a head-hunter :)Connections. Just like any other industry, it's a lot about who you know. Make connections wherever you possibly can.I stopped my car one day. Stepped out onto the road and started walking east. Soon I was fully immersed in the feild.... of corn...I know of the following examples:Elephant Robotics My CobotUFactory XArmFruitcore Robotics HorstBut I do not have experience with any of them.Depends on how complicated your code is going to be. That said, unless you're looking at some serious RL stuff, 2GB is probably plenty. If you are going the NN route though, you might consider something like a Jetson with gpu and a bit more memory.I don't want to slow your roll... is your goal to build robots or to program robots? because if it's the second one it's more affordable in every way to make a simulated robot (say, in unity) and then write control software to drive the simulation. that's how i did my first robot and I've done it that way ever since. Skip the hard and expensive part of building the machines, if you can.How long is a string? Fanuc used 32MB DRAM as the standard size in all their controllers until the last generation. If I remember correctly its 1GB in all the R30iB pluses..That will depend what type of arm, if it's KUKA, visual component, if it's ABB use robot studio, fanuc probably has something too. Or you could try looking for a ROS model and simming in Ros. But with as little information as you've given no one can really help you.This is the best thing related to robotics simulation. Found recently and really loving it.https://www.bottango.com/Robodk has pretty good support for different manufacturers.What software does the manufacturer suggest? ...did you buy an arm without software? Uh oh...The LRmate looks like it could be a little overkill considering how many axes it has. I’m not sure how these parts may be oriented, but is there a reason you’re not looking into a SCARA format robot here? I think that would help with your rigidity concerns, and they tend to be a bit cheaper than something like a 6 axis bot.The control pad looks like it was modelled after the space shuttle program. I love it.Can you please provide an explication or what this is and what it was used for. Then maybe what your plans are for it?Oh man. I wanted this so bad. I think they sold it through sears even. The Christmas wish book was legendary.What was that?Wow! It's in great condition.Childhood dream indeed! So freaking jealous!I remember seeing this on MR.Wizard and wanting it so bad as a kidCongrats! It seems like the Hero series from Heathkit gets less and less available to seek as the years go by. I remember first learning about Hero and Hero Jr. when I was a kid. Now as an adult, it took me close to 10 years to finally pick up both. Repairing them is quite the journey, but I learned a lot from tinkering with their circuitry and manuals, and that added to my inspiration for wanting to go into engineering. Looks like you're going to be giving your new Hero a good home, haha.You can certainly apply reinforcement learning to robot teaching, but for commercial practices, people generally avoid it. Particularly through techniques such as deep learning, any policies a robot learns are very brittle, and cannot maintain a high enough accuracy to consider them viable methods. If you consider a "picking" operation for example, anything less then ~99.9% accuracy just won't work. I think this will definitely change in the future, but right now it's just not worth it.That said however, there are definitely some applications of supervised learning that can help (i.e. identify parts or grasp affordances). But these are generally far from the control strategy you're talking aboutLook up "Learning from Demonstration"For a company that attempted to use this principle for industrial robots, check out the recently deceased Rethink RoboticsWhat's a "teach pendant"?Yes. It's just deep learning that has it's output adjusted by "rewards"That’s kind’ve the entire field of robotics right now? Boston Dynamics, Tesla, Google, OpenAI are all using reinforcement learning for their robotics? I assumed this was general knowledge? Every robotics article I’ve read in the past 2-3 years talks about machine learning and how it’s revolutionizing robotics. So yes, you can use machine learning methods to improve robotic training.Edit: Am noob and smarter people have commented more accurate information. BUT I believe this comment will hold weight a few years from now.A few reasons. They are high speed precision robots. They are co-robots meaning that they use a variety of internal sensors to be safe around people while operating and they can do things like near instant programming by manually moving it to position, pressing a button then moving it to the next position. The support team is more than just a phone call. They will send engineers to you. The end of the arm has a connection that can transfer power and data back and forth to whatever you want to put there. So you can stick a laser scanner, a camera, and force sensitive gripper on it with no external wires to run up the side of the arm. Etc. just some good engineering in general.I've never used the ufactory arm but am very famiar with Universal Robots, particularly the ur5 and ur3. The software is fantastic. It is incredibly easy to use and takes barely any time to get comfortable with it. This ease of use and quality of equipment easily justifies their asking priceSoftware and built quality of the UR robots is amazing, could also be labour costs, don’t know how much production they source outside of Denmark.Universal robots are real industrial tools with support, backend, customer service, reliability, and robustness, and ufactory are toys for universities and small shops to play with.There really is no comparison, a UR5 will run for 24 hours a day for years, a ufactory would break down in a month of the software could even keep it running that long.It's like comparing a $10 RC car at the toy store to a $600 Traxxas. They LOOK roughly the same, but there is really no comparison.Source: I worked in corporate research for ABB robotics for 6 years, and helped design YuMi and several other things like it.They have an approachable interface. The ease of use, integrated force torque sensor, and ability to do advanced interfacing from industrial protocols to the RTDE Interface make them a very well rounded system for specific use cases. Compared to industrial robots such as a Fanuc in similar reach and payload I think you'll find they are both in the same price neighborhood once the Fanuc is optioned out. Where the two types of arms begin to part ways is the use case. If you are doing light machine tending without exposure to oil based fluids the UR is pretty good. The IP rating is not that great on a UR. The older CB3 series UR joints were more robust in my experience over the newer E-series when using them for CNC machine tending. UR has a new redesigned joint coming out which time will tell of it's more robust. They've redesigned the joints to make it easier to produce with less parts.35k is just the beginning. When we were getting quotes that price nearly tripled when you throw in support, programming, installation etc. We were looking for CNC machine tending on a high mix low volume shopGood software + dominant market position.It takes a lot of effort to change one robot for another, mainly because of different interfaces.Because UR has been first in the cobot space, it's very popular. For the groups already using UR, it's cheaper to buy a new UR for 30k than it is to buy a cheaper equivalent.Robots are complicated products.Big companies tend to buy/rent expensive equipment from companies that have proven themselves.Downtimes are really really expensive.Cost. Robots are expensive as hell and only make sense when a huge number of repetitive tasks are required.First of all the number of corporations invested in robotics are very small because the outcome is usually very little. No CEO wants to invest on a project requiring 30 different disciplines which may pay back in the next 30 years or even won’t.Secondly every member of the team to work on a simple robot will be highly educated and therefore very expensive. Your company will need an enormous R&D budget.Also, the technology is not there yet (well, arguably) for a wide range of jobs for robots. The ones like car production line are strongly dominated by a couple of firms which you won’t be able to compete with.But we are getting there, all of the above will change in a couple of years.Honestly, you can go out to best buy right now and get a robotic vacuum cleaner for the same price as an old-skool manual one. My best guess is that the majority of people in a position to roboticize their company are baby boomers. They are luddites. They can't even wrap their head around working from home on a computer unless they are mandated to by a pandemic. My business partner is one of them. He still has to hand carry receipts over to our accountant and take a backup copy of the books over in person. He has to manually write checks rather than print them with our software. He insists that we don't use any machines in our labor intensive harvesting. He hated our automated watering system so much that he ripped it out and installed an old skool sprinkler controller. So, yeah it's mostly just old farts who are afraid of technology because they don't understand how to use it.Robots make the most sense for long run repetitive tasks... A car design won't change for several years, so robots make sense. Whereas consumer electronics change once a year or more... gotta have the latest/greatest, etc... Labor in China is dirt cheap, so it is cheaper to pay low wages, with the flexibility of being able to change production without large upfront capitol and development costs.In most cases a human can do the job of a robot for less. The robot only steps in once the savings are clear or there is an added benefit - precision, work all night, dangerous environment, etc.I disagreed with some of the commenters that it takes a huge r&d budget. It could just take will and time.Why only a handful of companies making industrial robots? If you were to start a company tomorrow that was going to compete with them, you would need to either make better robots or charge less. This would be difficult to do without some significant innovation protected with intellectual property.Why are they common in car factories and uncommon in some other factories? They are simply cost effective in some cases and not others. Spot welding thousands of identical steel components is perfect for robots. But robots currently suck at sewing together t-shirts. There are a variety of factors that play into this - the cost of the product, the amount of labor, the cost of labor, the volume manufactured, etc (not to mention similar factors applying to the robots). These things aren't fixed and are changing as new technology is being developed.Companies run on processes, defining processes is one hell of a task and usually there will be inconsistencies.Those do not matter because human personell is capable of giving feedback or working around dumb solution. If you need to produce B and need A and think about producing A and producing B but forget about getting A to the site where B is located human operators will fill in the blanks.If you tell a robot arm to move to position x and screw it will do this perfectly but if through some unforeseen circumstances like strain or abrasion x changes a tiny bit the tobot will malfunction, where a human might adjust.So in the end it is a matter of cost and in many cases defining the process sufficiently to then build a robot that can build stuff costs more tham using people, which can fill in the blanks.ro·bot/ˈrōˌbät,ˈrōbət/￼Learn to pronouncenoun(especially in science fiction) a machine resembling a human being and able to replicate certain human movements and functions automatically."the robot closed the door behind us"Similar:automatonandroidmachinegolembotdroida machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer.noun: robot; plural noun: robots"half of all American robots are making cars or trucks"I don't know about how universities can fill this void without having Professors being more aware of the market needs and adapting their courses to that.Still, there are many online courses on C++ and overall robotics topics that are decent enough for you to try something in your own. Try looking for some repos in GitHub to contribute to as well! It will help build your CV.For PLCs though, I think that is more expensive to learn by yourself, because of software licenses and equipment costs. I hope someone proves me wrong though :)Nothing is recession proof. That’s just the reality of itDo you know about Robot Arms? Do you think the controller for Robot Arm is same at the PLC? This company, Mujin(from Japan) is definitely not the standard, but it seems like they are selling this controller separately? Idk I would have to contact them to know about this. I also don't know about the standards Kuka, ABB, and other Robot Arm companies follow.PLC is not hard(it's deceptive, it can look easy, but it's not), please look at Codesys. The real pain in the ass is the debugging whatever janky code or logic you'll write. I'm in Germany in Master, and I've got PLC programming in Uni, but honestly it's very hard to learn everything in 1 semester, but I saw this course and I thought it's a good place to begin https://learn.realpars.com/collections/PLC-programmingSLAM is not an easy algorithm either, you can learn an entire semester and only learn the basics, again deceptively looks easy, but it's not.Perception is a very new field, don't be surprised if it's bleeding edge, many don't know what they are doing. Even the top AI experts burn out trying to solve it, c.f. Andrej Karpathy leaving Tesla and the entire AI codebase hit rock bottom as he was the only one coding the perception/AI stack according to Musk.C++, I think it's more to do with how good of a code you produce rather than if you know syntax, I don't think it takes much to know syntax but to produce good code needs knowing algorithms, and extensive experience in the industry.My suggestion as someone who is struggling to graduate the Robotics program. Take 1 path and stick to it, don't give a fuck about recession, you are gonna get fired anyway, if you are mediocre in all, you will be the 1st to be fired, if you are expert in 1, you might get fired but at least you will be the 1st to be hired by the competitor if you apply for jobs again.It depends on the niche/ industry. My company has a Greenfield / new construction side, and an after sales / modifications side.Greenfield constructions will definitely slow during a recession. Upgrades and optimizations will skyrocket during a recession.I’d bet that projects with new robots will slow, but retooling older robots will be more common.One of my companies, Reasonable Robot Repair, basically has this issue with new hires and we end up training them on this exact stuff for a few months. Most of their problems can be fixed with a phone call or two, but when it comes to programming plcs and c++, you just gotta take the time to learn it. It isn’t that difficult, just daunting.I think you’re relatively correctly in terms of industry vs academia, though good universities do teach C++, SLAM/localization, and learning for perception. I’d also add computer vision in that category. You may have to seek out these classes, and the description doesn’t always match. These are super hot topics in robotics that have been around for a while.But honestly, students ought to be looking at job descriptions and ensuring they have the necessary skills and qualifications to get a job when they graduate. It will take years and years to get deep knowledge in these areas, sure, but you just need to know enough to get your foot in the door. I bet your college offers classes in:cppmachine learningcomputer vision(possibly) SLAM, touched on in part of a course like optimal control & estimation, motion planning, etc.SpaceX, Blueorigin and NASA are hiring robotics majors. May I suggest you also learn ROS. Also you might look in the drone industry as it is booming. Largest is in Silicon Valley. Space and Drones are recession proof. DOD is also investing in USV and UGV so lots of opportunity in defense.any KUKA , ABB engineers here?It's so nice to have money.This is AMAZING. I am not from Kuka or ABB or Fanuc, Fanuc is what I’ve worked with mainly. In most industrial motors there are brakes which activate when unpowered. In servo motors, they continue to consume power when not in motion because of their holding force, to save power, many have brakes too.The motors you’re using look like Allen Bradley, they have inputs just for braking from the Kinetix modules. When power is lost it all depends on your settings how the robot will react but for the most part Fanuc robots operate on DC power. They have a pretty decent buffer between power loss and loss of power to the actual arm. Positional feedback is what keeps them put when braking isn’t used but when power is lost, braking is how they stay in place. I couldn’t imagine one of the 40 foot tall robots crashing down on a power loss, it would be catastrophic.Hi there,Have you ever heard about Kinova Robotics? It is a Canadian-based company that is delivering Pathbreaking Robotic Solutions for Research. The New Generation of Ultra Lightweight Robot offers the most open architecture on the market, as well as easy connection for many sorts of Robotic Grippers, Sensors or End Effectors with both Power and Communication Channels.

Mechanicalish engineering isn't exactly what you write on your CV.Do you have experience with C/C++? Any particular microcontrollers? Control theory? Interfacing with hardware?Hi there,you can check for offers in diverse mailing lists robotics-worldwide or eu-robotics, though most advertised jobs are for academia. Good luck!Hey friend! I just got a job in San Francisco as an embedded software engineer at a culinary robotics company. This is my first position out of university where I studied mechanical engineering. In order to get a software position in robotics as a mechanical engineering graduate it's hard to convince people that you can write professional level code and contribute to their project without hard experience and code samples (GitHub). I would say the most valuable skills that helped me land my job was C/C++ experience, building and design of robotics systems that involved microcontrollers and microprocessors and development of firmware. Overall you will be competing with Software engineers, computer engineers, CSC students who all "look" like a safer bet in terms of being a proficient developer. It will be your aim to convince them that your passion for robotics and your experience is worth taking a chance on you. A lot of people will turn you away, but once you land the first job it will snowball from there. I searched for jobs in the following areas which are dense for tech/robotics: SF /bay area, Boston, waterloo Ontario, Ann Arbor Michigan, Seattle. I used search platforms like LinkedIn and indeed. You may find a lot of "robotics software engineer" jobs where a lot will focus on perception or planning for robotics which are master's/PhD level material - consider avoiding these job postings. I applied to about 30 jobs in sf bay area, 20 in boston, 5 in waterloo and 10 everywhere else. I had interviews from 6 different companies and job offers from 3 (1 in SF, 1 in Cupertino, 1 in Waterloo). Feel free to ask other questions! Hope this helpsAre you trying to make robots(harder) or get to use and program industrial robots(easier)? If you’re interested in programming and working with industrial robots, look for jobs as a manufacturing or controls engineer that lists some specific robot brands in the posting ( Fanuc, Kuka, ABB, etc).Find some startups and apply. There are a lot of them out there, more in some locations than others, but probably a few in almost every major city. Put together a portfolio of your past work, as much media showing operating final products as possible, put it on youtube and flickr, and put links to it in your résumé. List your employment of course, but focus on your robotics work and the skills you've collected. If you've built multiple systems at home, then you have more hands-on experience than most of the PhD students I've worked with and in a startup environment you need generalists who can cover many areas at once. Highlight that.When it comes to Automation, 'custom' is always going to be more expensive than 'standard' or existing.I'm a full-time custom automation guy, and there's nothing new or even challenging about this system, with the exception of the front end software and/or User interface.Depending on how polished you want that to be, that alone could eat a good chunk of your $200k-$300k. If you want something you can drag and drop an AutoCAD drawing into, or some other slick time-saving way of programming, expect to pay for it.A six axis robot on a 7th axis is going to be in the $150k range from most of the big name robot manufacturers, and that's before you program it, or design and build any tools for it. Controls hardware is another big cost, and then all the programming...it adds up really fast.I'm sure you have rules of thumb for estimating costs as a GC, but a fair one for custom machines and automation in the states is 2.5X 'purchasing' cost for the total cost of the job.Feel free to shoot me a message on here if you want to connect offline and drill down on this to get a more accurate realistic cost, and if you're willing to share your labor numbers, we could figure out a rough ROI pretty quickly. Fair warning, my experience tells me it won't be a great ROI. But if you're fighting labor shortages or a lack of reliable semi-skilled labor, well, that's about half of what I do these days.Also, my budget is pretty flexible. We build a lot of homes every year so the work is kinda built-in to my roi calculations.The robot itself is 200kI have a quite extensive experience with xArm 6. No hardware degradation so far, and their software/firmware keeps improving. I like it.That said, xArm moves are less smooth than FANUCs or URs. If your application is sensitive to that, I would recommend to look further.Do you know if the XArm configurable input can be connected via Raspberry Pi GPIO? My understanding is that the Raspberry Pi GPIO is 3.3v.I've seen a couple of people use them for actual work (machine tending) versus just hobby type stuff.As an industrial robot guy, I probably wouldn't, but with the right attitude, some intelligent workholding and part handling, and maybe some tolerance for less than ideal performance, you could have some production done for 5-10% of the cost of a Fanuc, etc.Honestly just get an internship somewhere. The best way to learn stuff like this is through a 3d offline programming applications(for example Robot studio) but they are extremely expensive. A lot of robotic firms offer internships or courses to earn certifications so do that.Here's an alternative opinion from the answers already given: ROS is not required, classes are not required. Free simulators will teach you 50% of what you need, and you can learn the other 50% on the fly if you pay attention.Perhaps I am an idiot because I am self-taught, but I am also the "robot guy" at my company, and I am able to converse about the minutia of motion control with support engineers of robot manufacturers.Here's my rules for learning robot programming, coming from traditional software development:Real Life Experience > Manufacturer PDFs > Robot Theory > Google >>> ChatGPTAll robots use real-time OSs. Study the differences from traditional computer OSs (best-effort computing, safety margins, no true single-threaded execution)There are thousands of robot manufacturers, there's lots of copying designs, re-branding, and white labelling. The older brands tend to be the best, as robotics companies die more often than other fields, and it takes many years fix the myriad of small issues robots face.Robot software/program languages are usually not fully-featured when compared to traditional programming languages. You will be shocked at what features some robots lack (string parsing, string literals, function calls, for loops, local variables, ...)Kinematics crash course:A pose is translation (where you are) + rotation (where you are facing)A cartesian pose is measured with X/Y/Z (rectilinear space) + a rotation conventionA rotation convention can be one of: Euler Angles (Roll/Pitch/Yaw), Axis Angle (a vector to turn from/how much to turn), Quaternion (nonsense), Rotation Matrix (a 3x3 matrix describing a rotational transformation of X/Y/Z basis vectors).Quaternion/Rotation Matrix perfectly describe a rotation, only one set of numbers equals one rotation. Euler Angles/Axis Angle can describe a the same rotation with multiple sets of numbers. This means converting from RM -> EA for example can have up to 3 different sets of numbers be outputted.A joint pose for a 6-axis robot describes the angle to turn each robot axis or joint, so 6 numbers. If all joint values are within the limits the robot can turn, the position is reachable.Converting a joint pose to cartesian pose is easy, and is known as Forward Kinematics (FK). Inverse kinematics (IK) converts a cartesian position + extras into a joint position, this is harder.Robots are often able to compute IK quickly on the fly (say every 4ms or less), this allows a 6-axis robot to move in straight lines, even though it's individual joints do not move in straight linesRobots keep track of "extra" info mentioned above to ease IK calculation. This is usually whether the robot wrist is up or down (for singularities), number of 6th joint revolutions (for rotations past +/-360 deg), and other infoA singularity is an "awkwardness" in motion, whether it be position, velocity, or other. Place your arm straight up with your palm facing up. Now move you palm down as low as you can while keeping it facing up always. You will notice your elbow will wiggle around to accommodate this motion. You are approaching the singularity of your arm, you are making large joint motions in your arm which equate to small cartesian motions in your palm.Free simulators:ABB Robotstudio, free for 30 days, still usable afterwards: https://forums.robotstudio.com/discussion/14025/robot-studio-freemium-save-a-stationUR Polyscope, totally free, same as real robot pendant: https://www.universal-robots.com/download/software-ur20ur30/simulator-non-linux/offline-simulator-e-series-and-ur20ur30-ur-sim-for-non-linux-5180/Epson RC+, free for 30 days: https://epson.ca/Support/Robots/Software/Epson-RC%2B-7-0/s/SPT_R12N793031FANUC Roboguide, free for 30 days: https://roboticsbook.com/roboguide-v9-rev-d-download/Doosan, totally free with an account (I think): https://robotlab.doosanrobotics.com/en/board/Resources/Whats_NewRoboDK, free for 30 days: https://robodk.com/pricingThere are two main parts of "everything else": Mechanical, and Electronic.For most hobby-level robotics, the mechanical side of things is pretty simple. Learn about torque and power, and how to change them around (gears, pulleys, levers, etc.) and you're most of the way there. As long as your robot is small and moves reasonably slowly, it doesn't get much harder than that. I can't really offer a good book that covers this because my major is Mechanical Engineering and so my knowledge comes from a wide variety of textbooks and lectures.The electronic side is much more involved. The best thing that you can do is learn how to solve systems of equations. Learn Ohm's law. Learn Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws. Learn how to do loop current analysis.... The most important thing for a beginner in electronics is to realize that circuit schematics are not flow charts. Current does not flow down one wire and then another. Everything is moving all the time. I strongly recommend Practical Electronics Handbook by Sinclair and Dunton.Once you get into the more advanced robots, when you have a real budget and you're doing more complex things, believe it or not, the electronic side gets to be the easy part. The faster your robot moves and the more complicated moves it can make, the more advanced your mechanical analysis needs to be. College-level textbooks on kinematics, statics, and dynamics are your best bet. And just like the mechanics, the programming gets complicated much faster than the electronics. If you want to make a robot that can drive or fly around quickly, you get pretty deep into nonlinear control theory. Same for robot arms and motion planning.Oh, as far as recommendations for actual robot products go, check out sparkfun and adafruit and see if any kits really catch your attention. Otherwise, Mindstorms products make the mechanical and electronic assembly of the robot much easier - you don't have to worry about the electronics at all, and the mechanics are just lego technic. That said, you won't learn any electronic theory from playing with Mindstorms, so it's a bit of a compromise.I'm the same way as you. The programming side is super easy, but still struggling with the hardware side. I bought an arduino starter kit and built everything in the book that came with it. That was cool, but I didn't feel like I learned much. So next I spotted a book at Radio Shack, Getting Started in Electronics by Forrest M. Mims III. That book has been really helpful, but at times I feel like it's glossing over things. That may just be because I've been skipping around in it.The last few weeks I've been working on some simple projects to try and design circuits from scratch. I've burned out a few components, but I'm learning as I go. Last night I was working out the math to take 27V (3 9V in series) and drop the voltage/current down to 3.3V @ 500 µA. I'm trying to have a PIR sensor that will run at that level activate a buzzer that's capable of running at 28VDC @ 3A. It's simple (or should be), but I figure small steps one after another will lead me to bigger things.[edit] forgot a wordI'll try to get back to this but I have found one of the easiest things to wrap your head around and start understanding electronics with is the h-bridge. It's simple and easy to explain on the surface ...I'm in the same boat. Most of the Arduino tutorials I see are aimed at hardware people. They tediously explain what an if () statement is but assume you know how to hook up a MOSFET.I bought this book. I've not read it yet, but from what I've skimmed of it so far it seems pretty great -- just what I need. After that I think it's all about practical experience. Be ready to waste some money either damaging parts or buying the wrong parts. Luckily it's all pretty cheap.What kind of robot do you want to make?Learning electronics doesn't have to be hard - and I think that is probably the first step you should take. Once you get a handle on currents, voltages, and circuits, once you become comfortable around transistors, diodes, transformers, and relays - look into motor control. I'm talking pulse width modulation and maybe power electronics. At some point, sensors are probably going to become interesting to you, in which case you would want to brush up on analog-to-digital/digital-2-analog techniques and/or digital signal processing techniques. This would be where you programming background would become really useful. Probably the toughest and most abstract topic that would be of use to you would be control theory, where most of the topics I mentioned (in addition to other topics such as stability and linear systems) are drawn together and integrated into a nice theoretical framework. I'm sorry if this isn't necessarily the answer you are looking for, as it feels you're trying to learn on your own and I'm mostly describing the course work from my time as an electrical engineering student. But perhaps it can serve as a starting point for you and you can pick/choose what the most relevant things are for your particular case.EDIT: Forget my brain vomit. Listen to u/scorinth.When you say you are interested in robotics, what do you mean? Some people love learning the minuscule differences between thousands of electronic components and building their own electronics boards. Other people love working equations of force, mass, leverage etc and get a kick out of physically making wheels and gears and chasis. Others are interested in robotics because they want to see the robot do something.If you care about getting to see a robot do anything more than an incredibly trivial task I suggest you not get into building robots yourself. Buy a good kit, put it together, and do what you're good at. The world needs much better robot software, it does not need another dozen half-finished amateur robot bodies that can sorta-kinda do line following.Hi!I run marginallyclever.com. You are me, ~ five years ago.At that time, I made the decision to avoid electronics as much as possible. If I could find it in a pcb, buy it. If not, do something else. That freed me up to focus on learning mechanics.I started by picking some robots I liked and studying how and why they worked. I built YouTube playlists for each type, I read the assembly documents, I practiced drafting by drawing my own versions of the parts. I made digital models of each part for my robot and built it in OpenGL, then taught the computer model to move. Cheaper than frying real motors!At the time if never touched a microcontroller or a servo. It took about 6 weeks to build bought an 18 servo crab that walks. I was so dumb i didn't know I couldn't do it.These days, I still don't do electronics. I get smart young men who've learned to design my circuits for me, and focus on the part I'm good at. I highly recommend building a team with a few people. The collaboration will make things faster, better, and more pleasant.I hope that helps.If you can go to Canada for school, I found a program called manufacturing engineering technology, welding and robotics at Conestoga college to be really effective. I dont feel like software engineering will help with robotic welding.Lots of money in that area right now. Most of it is military contracts from what I've experienced. Check out metal 3d printers and companies that do that. Most of them are just welders on an arm or normal fdm printing body. The one I worked on was a little fancier, we used lasers to melt powder metal instead of rods, things like platinum, steel, and glass rods. Most people I know working in the area have masters/doctorates. But you could probably get into a company as an intern and then get a fulltime gig later.Edit: If you are going back to school see if they have some 3d printing groups or research groups in that area and join those.I do not know enough about ROS (yet) to understand the depth of the question and the complications that are found in dealing with random vendors control boards.Open Source should not be a business idea. It should be a basic foundational expectation.The current vendors have to see the value in not having to build the interface languages and know that the open source product will be better than anything they could build alone.They have to be encouraged that the security of having the code base in the open environment is worth losing customer lockin to their aging platforms.It is a lovely idea and I think the main problems groups run in to when they try to do this is they lack an understanding of incentive alignment. Open source is fine, but if you want cross compatibility with companies like Fanuc and ABB, you need to understand what would incentivise them to enable rather than block this compatibility.One of the big issues with open source stuff is liability. When something goes terribly wrong, who is responsible for making whom whole? If ABB sells a customer a robot and the customer uses an open source controller and the robot crashes because a load within the loading range of the robot but outside the controller tolerance weighs it down, is ABB responsible for selling a robot incapable of holding the rated weight? If the controller is responsible who pays for the damages?Also with open source what incentivises companies to keep innovating that product line? First, most open source licenses have a viral trigger so anything novel developed code wise has to be publishes and any advantage gained by their development is immediately accessible to competitors, in addition, they have tons of active development for free.I'm not saying open source is bad, I'm saying applying it to an industrial environment requires and innovative breakthrough I have not yet seen.What do you think about a generic controller that could operate seamlessly two different industrial robot manipulators?I've been in this field (palletizing and depal) for more than a decade. There have been many solutions in the market. the big players sell the solutions as software add-ons. For example, Yaskawa's PalletSolver.It's a very competitive market for homoegenous palletizing (a relatively easier problem) because it's easy and the vision side is pretty much solved. Random box depal/pal is where the sauce is.These lab-demoed solutions come apart in a warehouse-like situation.Why use a cobot here? A normal robot would do the same but in a cage.Or is it just research for students?UR5 is not a great choice for palletizing. Limited reach and payload, slow compared to industrial arms, and not as reliable long term. Then again, Fanuc etc are a steeper learning curve so a small shop might have to spend more on integration.That robot is not in collaborative mode or safe mode. UR and others can move fairly fast only behind fencing. The other factors to consider.The life of the robot. Collaborative robots need joints replaced regularly.Payload, less than 30 lbs boxes (approx)Reach is super limited to the pallet heights need to be half or less.I must confess I don't find this impressive in any way. It's slow in a super controlled environment.Oh great, 3 skilled people in a tightly controlled env can do 1 persons job... slow.I'm guessing this isn't running at full speed? Because, in all honesty, the guy could've palettized the boxes himself in the time it took for it to roll down the conveyor, and get p-&-p'd by the robot.You can do Phd on RoboticI'm a computer engineer who's worked as a robotics engineer and my only qualification for getting the position was a robotics course in the final year. (It was pretty hard though). I recommend you take a quick robotics course and just apply.Robot sims are basically game engines, and distributed simulation is basically a multi-player game. It’s possible to have two game engines use the same multiplayer API to communicate with each other, but I have no idea how easy that is, and would guess that it’s harder than just putting all the robots into the same engine.cool and brilliant idea I just posted similar inquiry about a robot with solar base station to act as sentinel in paddocks in Australia to identify wild dogs near live stock and harass/chase away from live stock as well as notify farmer with pictures in real time. My skills in robotics are very base but a non lethal sentinel robot with wild dog recognition should be pretty stock build I'm guessing. There is a big market for such a robot and I am thinking it is just a robot vac with a few extra steps? I'm not looking to make money I'd love to help make an open source build and software but I am certain there would be plenty of opportunity to sell premade builds. My motivation is to protect the Australian Dingo but there are wolves ect in other country's where it could also be marketed. Even a basic build with limited range from base station would be awesome as long as it can contact the farmer in real time. This could even attract government support in Australia if it helps protect the Dingo which sadly is being hunted to the brink still today. I also though a robot to live in rabbit burrows and chase them out of the burrow could make a lot of money as farmers could drop them at burrows in Australia that has a nightmare with rabbits. I am certain there is a strong market for such robots in Australia alone let alone the rest of the world. I think this is a win waiting for someone to do it.I really don't think robotics arm is all that rocket science.The devil is in the details. invest in costly R&D that might not pan our, or buy a well tested machine under warranty and spend your R&D time on something else.It'll depend on the business and on what they're trying to build. I speak from the experience of working at companies that both out-source code and develop in-house. I think it'll be very similar depending on budget and task.Sure the manufacturing of robots themselves is dominated by a select group of companies, but the application of those robots is still a wide open game and what most industrial automation groups work on.To echo what i-make-robots said, the devil is in the details. The "last 10%" of development effort costs 90% of the time and money. Industrial robots are even worse because they are expected to be VERY robust machines with many 9's of reliability AND they must be safety rated. Modern collaborative robots just make this problem worse.There will always be a market for specialized needs: very large, very small, very precise, very stiff, etc. In some of these cases in-house robots are used. Even in those cases, it often doesn't make sense to start from absolute scratch. Some integrators have been known to buy large Kuka robots, throw away the motors and controllers, and replace them with custom hardware or hardware built on CNC controllers like the Siemens 840D.A lot of this has to do with the fact that industrial robot arms are still really hard to apply outside of a few well-understand domains. These are typically material handling (moving stuff) and welding. Other stuff like automated painting, grinding, cutting etc. The vendors have ready-made solutions for these so it makes sense to just buy them.Anyway, I think the mobile robot space is way more open.Nope!I've just had an interview at a company trying to custom-build industrial robots cheap enough to rent them out, rather than just sell. I don't know that will work out right now, but at some point the cost of building these robots will be reduced enough that it becomes a problem of whether it's worth hiring contractors to provide you a custom-design, or to do it yourself. Or so I think.It didn't go very well. The guys interviewing me basically saw me as what I was. Fresh out of university having not done time during it. They basically told me that they were disappointed not to see a list of projects I did at home. Everything I told them I'd done, they basically said "Yeah, everyone says that".It's not heading in this direction. Manufacturing and logistics corporations are looking for **turnkey solutions** as they focus on their manufacturing process and distribution challenges. Larger companies already have in house engineering teams, however what I am observing is that with modern air travel and the internet, companies are trying to consolidate and spread their engineering talent over larger areas. We probably won't see each plant or warehouse having their own team of engineers any time soon. Even the places that are large enough for it are starting to contract out their facilities staff to agencies like JLL who gain much better leverage in contract negotiation since they are massive staffing agencies (It's disgusting, somethings going to have give eventually I'd wager).Instead, growth is going to be driven by application fragmentation. As automation technology becomes more common and widespread, new and distinct applications will emerge. One company that owns a turnkey market segment always runs into challenges keeping up with pace of technology, and this will open up new business opportunities for smaller companies with a superior approach to a problem. You see it everywhere, big companies get really good at something, drive up demand, and then as they grow start taking on less risk, leaving the riskier applications to newer, smaller more flexible companies that can develop new technology to address the new business opportunity. The jury is out on whether this is sustainable, but its what you get when you combine automation engineering with business.That has been my experience in the automation industry anyway. This probably came off as vague and rambly, but whatever it's late.Also, robot arms are pretty complicated. Even if you consider 6 DOF a solved problem, industrial grade arms will still run you tens of thousands of dollars. Human arms are 7 DOF by comparison. And the math behind them is insane - you end up with some pretty massive matrices. Last time I checked, researchers are were still having trouble finding ways to simplify the kinematics so that you don't have to model each individual linkage, and it might even be mathematically impossible. My alma mater is the birthplace of rocket science, and they currently do quite a bit of serial manipulation research there.Yes, RAPID programmers are much sought after, and IMHO the language is the most modern one of the vendors I've looked into ( ABB, Kuka, Fanuc ). RobotStudio latest version (5.15) comes with a pretty decent editor, and the integration with the 3d viewer gives you something pretty close to and IDE for robotics. I would recommend you to check out sites such as robot-forum which allows you to develop some idea of the pros and cons of the individual languages. A strength of ABB is not only that RAPID is a clean and nice language to work with, the killer feat I think is that there is no discrepancy between the virtual controller embedded in RobotStudio and the controller running your robot. This is a huge deal; for instance I'm generating code from my mac and piping it over the socket to the virtual controller running on a virtual machine. This makes debugging messaging pretty much a walk in the park.So yes, RAPID is good fun. Dont compare it to the dynamism of Python ( I guess that would be seriously unsafe ). Install RobotStudio and within a day or two you should have a pretty good idea whether its something you. Check out something like the open abb driver and then cross reference how other languages do something like that. While your at it, RelTool is something that's pretty unique to RAPID?Can you alter the placement angle slightly, or is the angle dependent upon the orientation of the box? If so, see if the box tends to warp in one direction when compressed. Perhaps caused by the design of the boxes/contents of the box. Any defects in the gripper surface? Any inconsistency in the top surface of the box that might affect its interaction with the gripper? Any slop in the joints of the arm? Is the end effector still moving when the box is placed? Does any one corner of the box touch down before the others? Is there clear misalignment in the end effector (perhaps errors in the code). Is the pallet misaligned? You can do some preliminary testing by getting the arm to its home position, then jogging it until the end effector is pointing forward straight down, check alignment, check that the box drops straight. If you can rule out hardware you know it must be software or tuning. That's all I can think of for now.Whenever I see consistent errors in angle, I always check my transforms first. Because it's so consistent it's most likely a static transform, regarding one of your sensors and their pose relative to your manipulator.Both your pick and place should have separate, taught frames.If you're picking the boxes square and using world for the placement, I'd say the base of the robot isn't square to your pallet.May we please see a video of the problem? It's not clear to me from the description what is going on. I think in pictures.if you try to get a generic software position as you say you will get a big surprise... it's kind of dead rnIt is a horrible job market. Everyone is saying the same thing as you ... it sucks.Hi, I am hiring in the US for robotics, also some of my partners look for engineers. Contact me if interested.My company is hiring globally for robotics and industrial automation. We do lots of CV/SLAM in our CA-based divisions, but the company isn’t necessarily hiring for those roles right now. We have some application engineer and firmware engineer roles available in the US. There are more options if you speak a foreign language and are willing to move to Japan or Europe.I work with robotics. We manufacture automated packaging machines with integrated fanuc bots. Business is… very strongHello, my name is Samuel. I'm 19 years old and a highschool graduate, not in college.A while back, I was almost ready to give up. 600+ applications and I was still unemployed with rent due on the table.The secret really is to just keep at it. Polish your resume to be relevant to what you want in life. Just keep at it and keep applying for jobs when they pop up.Almost 7 months ago I landed a job as a reserve engineer for a mobile security robots company. Almost two weeks ago I landed my second job as a safety tester for a forklift robot company. Then I'm having dinner with the CEO and founding engineers. Now I'm flying out to California in December for a Christmas party with the company. Plane ticket isn't even going to be out of my pocket!I'm baffled at however the hell I managed to get so lucky. All I can say is keep trying and talk passionately about your hobbies too! You'll get there, somewhere, eventually!The robotics industry needs to branch out into industrial applications, not just cars… the machine vision market is a monopoly of Sick, Keyence and in robotics KukaMy company is looking for robotics/computer vision engineers around NYC/Jersey City. DM me your resume if you're interested!Edit: Added locationJust sent you DM, check out South West Research Institute. They have some openings.Example of what I'm working with todayFANUC robots https://imgur.com/gallery/tc69AIf I'm making high cost stuff and my margins and reputation depend on how quickly my floor can move product within a world of statistically demonstrated repeatability and reproducibility in placement, how do your tests help me sleep at night?Sorry to be late to the party, and I apologize if my question comes off confrontational - even at all.I want to implement a welding arm in our facility for large production repetitive stuff (mostly pipe welding, but structural too). Our guys are journeyman welders, but very lacking in the tech sode. Are there "training" modes for the arm so you can simple trace the weld areas and then it goes back over? How much time is invested in the control programming or is it pretty user friendly?Cooler than the ones I work with. The ones I see at work are mainly wafer handling robots or FOUP transfer trolleys (semiconductor fab). Thanks for putting this together!The market of true robotics jobs is quite small, but there are many companies that have people applying the same computer vision and machine learning techniques which form the core of robotics (if you exclude the planning space). But you appear to be coming from the non-academic side.Robotics companies need people with strong general software skills, because the PhD types are usually more algorithms focused. To land one of those jobs you need really strong Linux, C++, and computer networking skills. Having a masters degree with somewhat related experience helps as well.For me I worked at a lab that did robotics as an undergrad. While doing that I was a founding member of a robotics club that won an international AUVSI robotics competition. My undergrad degrees were in engineering & computer science (which I added because of my robotics interest). I used that experience to get into masters in robotics program.I currently have job at a company that does pure robotics like Boston Dynamics, iRobot, NREC, etc. I got that job because of the skills I learned and my masters degree.I've always aimed my life towards robotics, and would consider myself a failure in the long run if my career doesn't end up there. Here's the path I took / am taking:I graduated from University a year ago, B.A.Sc. Mechatronics Engineering (Honours, co-op) with two minors I believe are relevant to robotics (Biomechanics, Cognitive Science). I took all the robotics classes UWaterloo offered, which really just amounts to : Digital Controls (required in my curriculum), Robot Manipulators (robot arms), and Autonomous Mobile Robotics.Clearly right out the gate, virtually noone will get their dream job. I live in Mississauga (just outside Toronto), home to MD Robotics (Canadarm people), and was VERY lucky enough to get a job working under the head of software development on the Canadarm. this was pure dumb luck -- this company works in Aerospace, and they grabbed this guy to build the reputation of the company.The thing about "robotics" these days -- its a developing industry. Currently my job is testing and verifying some control systems for the upcoming Airbus A350. Robot in conventional sense? absolutely not. Autonomous operation? Absolutely. So where does one draw the line?What kind of robotics are you interested in -- mobile autonomous (androids, 'Big Dog', UAVs) or robot manipulators (those big guys that build cars, robotic prosthetics, etc.)?Don't look at me. I've been building them as a means to securing patents. I don't know anyone in the biz who'll take me seriously. If you find out how, please let me know. You might have more luck asking in r/engineeringI have been working at a small robotics institute (10 people) for about 5 years or so, and we mostly hire people who have studied software engineering or mechatronics. This is in Austria, so things might be quite different here.We are currently expanding, and specifically look for graduates in software engineering, perferrably with experience in 2D / 3D machine vision, robotics, and parallel programming.I got a PhD in Robotics and work for a robotics company now. There certainly aren't many options out there and I am very happy to have found one. Software skills, both alone and as part of a team, are very important. Robotics companies also need talented mechanical designers and electrical engineers. It's kind of hard to be all of the above, I think they are generally looking for someone outstanding in one of these areas who can work well with people doing the others.The most important thing if you want to work for a robotics company is experience working with real hardware. It's not a requirement, but it will give you a huge edge over people that haven't.Until recently, I was employed part time in an industrial robotics company. Those are robots that mainly run the same program over and over again, where stuff like vision is used like a simple sensor. I got in through an internship for my mechatronics bachelor. And kept sticking until my masters started demanding too much time.I love the way it casually flicks the cans across the room.too slow, too bulky. this instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bur5g2rvXogx post from r/fanucSeems self defeatingThis is amazing!But did you notice the difference between lab trash and real life trash? I wonder how this system fares.....If there are no built in cable runs for ethernet/networking your best bet is to add the calling externally. What we see do of there isn't an option of a dress pack is to cable tie or velcro tie some flexible conduit to the arm and run cables through that. Or, as you said this is a hobby, not industrial project. You could try using a power line adapter kit over the power cables, the protocol they use is designed to run over unshielded cables in electrically noisy environments. However, that might not be able to withstand the electrical noise from the motors, but you'll have to test and find outInstead of wifi, why not use packet radio with error correction and a directional antenna?You don't want to use wifi because there is bad signal ?If your robot does not have an ethernet connection built in, your best bet is to run it externally along the arm using the dress pack mounting points.Some Fanuc robots have built in Ethernet cables. I’ve added external Ethernet cables up to tools on other robots and used hi-flex robotic cable (Oflex and others). Design should be made to allow easy replacement and customer should be prepared to replace this cable periodically.Good thing, the industrial robot companies have been ripping everyone off for far too long. Hope foxconn starts selling their bots soon.that's not a robot it's a small Asian boy in a metal case.Just $20k!?! They're going to destroy everything in the manufacturing market with costs that low!Will they make more robots using those robots?I for one welcome the beginning of the end of compulsory human labor.Unless I'm not correct, that robot looks very similar to a Fanuc, I mean I'm on an iPhone so the picture may have not loaded and I'm looking at the wrong one... Oh btw guys... Hi! I'm new here!Big egos, can we automate those away?The worst part about robotics. Is that in most companies, somewhere up the chain of command, someone doesn't understand a single thing about robotics. (But they think they "get it")And your support wavers and falters if the person immediately reporting to them is a poor communicator: to help break down the underlying problems, and solicit the resources or the dictatorial powers needed to fix it.I have a weird suggestion.I don't want to keep wiping my ass. I really like japanese toilets with bidet, they feel much cleaner, but I still have to get in there myself.Please find a way for the process to be automated.My colleagues are all idiots. Can you do something about that?Dealing with management is my biggest time sink, if you want to automate that I'd be grateful.I have ineffective managers. Can you automate management/owners first?As a robotics engineer in a small team, you're also the embedded-, cloud-, frontend-, electrical-, architecture-, ai-engineer besides beeing customer support and full time researcher.take laundry from washer to dryer and begin dryerHey buddy. I’m a robotics technician, and I have a pretty varied day. I can only speak for my operation but my duties can include:1). Troubleshooting uncommon robot errors 2). Program adjustments based on feedback from the floor, usually just alter a couple points. 3). Creation of programs for new products that are incoming. 4). Fair amount of meetings about quality and production efficiency.I feel like I have a fun balance of on floor and office work and I really enjoy it.Save your money and dont go to school for it. That was such a huge waste of time and money for me. None of my jobs ever asked nor do they care if you have ever gone. What they care about if you know how to build things. Learn servos really well. Learn logic. Learn controllers. Learn how to create things from PLCs. Networking helps too.It entirely depends on which company you end up working for. you could end up in a design job or in a maintenance job and the tasks are totally different.since you don't want to program go for a maintenance style job where you will fix damaged robots, touch up positions after they've collided with stuff and just generally troubleshoot.The design side is in a cushy office, the maintenance side is in a dirty factory.Whether the factory is dirty or not entirely depends on what it makes. if you're making solar panels it might be clean if you're making truck bumpers it's not going to be.I spent 10 years as an IT guy five years as a robot programmer and then moved into building research robots for University.my job has let me travel the world installing robots and meet a lot of interesting people.There definitely will not be less robots in the future.I went through Conestoga colleges automation and robotics 3 year program, I can take a one year upgrade and become an engineer!Can you provide a link for the apprenticeship program? I just want to better understand what you mean.I recently started my graduate role as a controls engineer for an automation company. I can't speak to what typical duties would be but the majority of my training is based around PLC programming, panel wiring, SCARA and Articulated Robot simulation and programming, and a operation of various sensors and actuators (mostly Pneumatics).I did go to university and completed an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering degree, followed by a postgraduate Mechatronics masters but I would firmly agree with texwitheffects, my employer was more concerned with my practical know how than my theoretical understanding and seemed to value my side projects portfolio more than my academic achievements.There are actually companies that take used robot arms and reach uproar them on their machines. Unfortunately, I can’t think of a large enough company that would have multiple locations so you could get in touch with one of the branches. Usually these companies are rather small, <20.I would say best best is googling “machine builder in x” and x being your location. It’ll take some pages, but with any luck you’ll find a company with an info page that states something along the lines of repurposing/using robot arms for their equipment.Talk to Fanuc people in their Rochester Hills, MI facility. They do deal with used robots, I believe, and may have channels to move them.Look for warehouses, metalworking, and large production plants near you. Inquire about what they're already automating and see if they have any cycle, location, or product that they think could be made more efficient with automation. The management likely already has ideas about that, but send your people over for an assessment/quote to see if your machines/services would be enough for what they have.Is it just me then or is there really no organized way of businesses finding automation companies, and automation companies finding customers? Maybe trade shows?Try using Lead-Gen tools like Oxyleads or Clearbit to find customers for your business.The industry still relies heavily on trade fairs, but it's expensive to exhibit and the visitor numbers are declining.You can use on online marketplace or matchmaking tool for robot integrators like Qviro Match. Check out www.Qviro.comI'd recommend Fusion especially if you're a student.Whilst others might be easier to pick up, Fusion is pretty intuitive and powerful. It's also got really good integration for manufacturing.Has anyone tried onshape? Is it any goodYou could just start with tinkercad just so you get an idea of 3D modelling. Then you can move on to Fusion360 like within a week. Fusion is easy to pickup and you can find a lot of tutorial on youtube.i found this playlist helpfulhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHEouj-sdEJEm_xextUwnfhRJEdUs2hn4&si=a0G_3P7c10qtnlS5Also you could practice using this bookhttps://zlib.pub/book/autodesk-fusion-360-exercises-200-practice-drawings-for-fusion-360-and-other-feature-based-modeling-software-7jm9rmualfg02nd on fusion, if you ever get very into it and want to move to something more professional but still familiar you can switch to inventory, from there you'll be familiar enough with cad that you could easily swap to solid works.Fusion360what do you want to do exactly? fusion is cool but does not support simulationFusion hands down! That’s mainly what we teach people that are past the simplicity of TinkerCAD but don’t want to pay for a professional program. You can download our free book at CADclass.org if you’d like :)I have professional experience with Creo, NX and Catia. The easiest to learn and use was Creo Elements Direct Modelling. That answers your questiin, but I can't recommend it because you will be learning a program that hardly anyone uses anymore.With the first R30iB Plus robots shipping out now and a SCARA unit set to be announced this winter, there is a lot to look forward to from them.One interesting area they've really been pushing lately that is sure to pull in a lot of sales is ease if integration; there is a serious effort to be able to set up simpler applications with a simple setup walkthrough instead of "programming".ABB makes a much better product in my experienceA lot of the robotic arm companies are actually behind the times in terms of collaborative robots. UR is emerging as the clear winner in that trend moving forward.This is the best tl;dr I could make, original reduced by 96%. (I'm a bot)We don't find Fujii, so I leave the campus with little more than a glimpse of the world behind Inaba's forest: a clock above the entrance to the main research facility that ticks at 10 times the usual speed, as if innovation can't happen quickly enough for the world leader in factory automation technology, plus several 40,000-square-foot factories, each of which contains hundreds of bright yellow Fanuc robots working around the clock to build other Fanuc robots, stopping only when no storage space remains.When you have lots of efficient robots making your other robots, you can sell those robots more cheaply-about $25,500 for a new Robodrill.Between the almost 4 million CNC systems and half-million or so industrial robots it has installed around the world, Fanuc has captured about one-quarter of the global market, making it the industry leader over competitors such as Yaskawa Motoman and ABB Robotics in Germany, each of which has about 300,000 industrial robots installed globally.Extended Summary | FAQ | Feedback | Top keywords: robot#1 Fanuc#2 company#3 work#4 more#5Hmmm I don't know if you could do it or not but i would look into doing the FIRST lego league Jr. and FIRST lego league competition. I can't really tell if you can do those competition as you dont have access to aloy of budget. FIRST is the organization that does those competitionsGo here: https://www.firstinspires.org/find-local-supportSee if there’s a local robotics team that can help you. The Teams should be doing outreach in the community, and can provide advise, guidance, trainings, demonstrations and potentially supplies. Our team arranged for all lego robotics kits for every middle school in the district.Knock off Arduinos are cheapTry some free robotic simulator for PC too... something like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZveCcS0PN-M a visual based approach could be interesting for kids, too, rather than pure programmingThere’s some old lego robotics kits that are decently affordable if you can find them, they connect via Bluetooth to a laptop and you can build little cars and race with them.I did this at a teaching position I had and it kept the kids busy for hours.You can make a hydraulic actuated arms with some wood, some syringes and some tubes. Quite easy to do. Can also add a simple electromagnet using a battery and can use the arms to pick up paperclips.I've taught this age range (plus older high schoolers, college age, teachers, and professional development for FANUC robots). Hit me up via DM if you'd like, I'd be happy to share any and all of my knowledge regarding this.In general, yes that should be fine. Most automation enterprises buy COTS arms and utilize them to provide a specific function.Robot arms can currently be used for highly repetitive tasks in controlled environments. Most of what we mean by repetitive is moving through a set of points. The thing to keep in mind is that robots are not very good at manipulating things on their own. We can tell a robot how to build a chair, but the robot can't figure how to put that chair together on its own, even if we give it an ikea instruction booklet in a format the robot can understand.This goes over some limitations of robot arms in current systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Guided_Robotic_SystemsTo answer your second question, absolutely. You could patent the process too, at least in the case of hair cutting.I understand this is an example, but cutting hair with a robot arm is going to be hard. Dealing with flexible things like hair and interacting with people are currently hard problems for robots to deal with.It's not only possible, but extremely common. People like Kawasaki and Fanuc make robot arms with the intent to sell them to companies (like mine) that will use them to do all sorts of things. You don't need to find legal loopholes to use industrial robots, you just buy them and use them in your projects. That's what they're for.Of course you could profit off what a robot does for you. Thats is the intent of these robotic arms. Your business is the integration not the hardware. Just open your thought process to apps for phones and programs for PCs. None of those developers build hardware. They just write code that operates on someone elses hardware. They have companies who's sole purpose is to do what you do. They are a ABB of Fanuc robotics official reseller and they sell arms to customers and add the level of customization they want. These companies are small enough to habdle a niche customer and make a profit where ABB and fanuc don't see the benefit with bothering with 1 customer for a $25k customization job when they are trying to sell bulk robots. Here is a model business. It is a robotic arm that serves frozen yogurt. Some company bought a robot arm and programmed/customized it to serve frozen yogurt. They have some patent over the mechanisms and concepts they built and sell the franchising rights so others can pay them to start their own robot business.http://www.reisandirvys.comBtw a hair salon robot is a bad idea because people don't pay for the manual dexerity. They pay for the human who can listen interact adapt and listen to their silly stories. http://douglasj.edu/blog/2014/12/12/the-five-traits-of-a-great-hair-stylist/Do a LOT of research about robotic safety in a collaborative setting. As far as I am aware, collaborative robots are not yet developed to the point where they are safe enough to use as close to a human as you are saying. Especially an untrained person buying a haircut instead of a technician.Just one hazard example: many collaborative robots can still break a finger if you put it close to a joint because of the immense mechanical advantage that prevents your finger from resisting enough to trip the safety.What you mentioned is fine from a legal standpoint. In fact, automated services have been around for a long time. Many online businesses are literally just programs that relay your order to a separate online drop shipping company, and they utilise mostly pre-packaged software.Just in case you're actually interested in opening a robotic hair salon: There are robots available that are allowed to work around humans without safety barriers. Having said that... If you arm the same robot with a pair of scissors it's a completely different story. There will be no end of legal hoops to jump through when it comes to implementing such a system. Also, it's very hard to get a robot to cut hair as well as a human. Even getting a robot to cut hair at all will be a hard task. Actually, I imagine it is among the hardest of tasks for a robot to perform. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try though.Best of luck.Somewhere people can not go, but the robotic arm can stay.It all depends on your electronics. I see no good reason to implement an expensive and proprietary PLC controller on a DIY build.But your use of the phrase “I am trying to build an industrial robot arm” is a bit ambiguous. Are you talking about the kind of arm you see in a car factory? If you’re actually making something from scratch I really doubt you have the resources to make a truly industrial arm with high rigidity, high power, low backlash and repeatability. And if you did it would still be enormously expensive. Just add up the cost of motors, encoders, controllers, power supply, and gearing, that’s the main cost there. Add on top the cost of structural components, flex cabling, bearings, shafts, machining you will go way over the cost of a second hand Kuka or Fanuc machine even before throwing in thousands of hours of labour.Nice, upvotedYou haven't provided enough context here. Are you going to buy a robot arm? Are you going to design and build it yourself? If so, what kind of motors do you want to use?All of these will change what kind of controller you needStay away from PLCs for robotics programming first of all. Function blocks and structured test are just not suited for that application (in my opinion). You can get it to work, but it won't be a fun experience.As someone else mentioned, industrial arm is a little ambiguous. Do you need a cartesian, a gantry, or a full 5-6 axis arm? What's you budget, and how much is your time worth to you? Most of my customers (I work in industrial automation/robotics/motion control), we provide off the shelf 5-6 axis robotics solutions, and build custom gantry and cartesian systems. The latter is easier to piece together and design yourself (and would work fine with a PLC). The robotic arm you could put a ton of sweat equity into the design and debug, when from a cost standpoint you'd have been better off just buying one.Background in programming ABB robots. The language they’re programmed in is a variation of C++, and is honestly reminiscent of gcode. It just takes location information and pumps it into the controller to do the heavy mathematic lifting and create the proper axis motion.On the hobbyist level, I’m honestly not certain what’s really out there.None of the programming is done on a keyboard though, in most instances we do it all with a CAD style virtual environment and go back and maybe do a bit of text editing. If not virtually, it’s done on the fly with a HMI directly connected to the robot. If you can somehow get your hands on a seat of robot studio, that would be an awesome primer for getting your feet wet in an virtual programming environment. I know my university had seats, you just had to pester the proper people to get access to it. But that’s only an ABB platform and I can’t really speak to any others.Like working with PLCs or research stufd?I'm not sure about hobbyist robots, but you could use a simulated environment to practice programming industrial robots.many operations delegate control at different levels. If you want to work the hardware its going to be C/C++ and ladder logic.If you want to work in control then you may be writing C/C++ or even Java or .NET. This started in the automation industry back in the 90s mainly because the hardware folks often need some EE, some ME and some CS to be successful. Thus abstraction is used to you can employ developers with less alphabet soup in their resume and still be effective.There are sims you should be able to run, its also not uncommon to just write your own sim.Have a look Into my history. The ik is Programmed on industry standard. (But no dynamics)Pm me if u are interestedDo you have to purchase all of it this year? You should talk with other students on what you as a group want to do.That said, I'd recommend investing in tools and parts for projects that the group wants to do.I'd also recommend purchasing high quality microcontrollers, not Arduino, but STM32, Teensy, ESP32/ESP8266, LoRa.For drones, purchase Pixhawk flight controllers, and a bunch of ESCs and Motors.Hopefully you have large tools as well, such as Mills, lathes, CNC router table, shear, brake, bandsaw, etc for a full fab workshop. If that's not the case I'd recommend looking at getting those or other tools/systems for your fabshop. Also don't forget about composites. Those alone can easily eat your 10k on one of them.Theoretically it's possible to get a 1000W CNC laser from China for only $10k, which can cut through 10mm thick steel. That's what I'd get.I have a ton of 80/20 style extrusions in stock, which I constantly pilfer for new projects. It's a good idea to have some standardized (ie: either all metric or all SAE sized) extrusions around to make it easy to share via CAD across projects.Do you have instrumentation? A good power supply or two, one nice oscilloscope, and a few good multimeters are essential if you'll be doing electrical work. You could also get some software defined radio (SDR) equipment to start in the RF realm.Talk to someone at a lab that's done CubeSats or other small sat work before (UMich comes to mind) to see what they found useful.What are your ultimate goals for this purchase?I would add some depth cameras to the list, if doing stuff related to vision-based robotics.When I was in college here's what I did. Reach out to manufacturers directly, for instance I went to Texas Instruments and found a sales contact number. They were willing to provide free "demo" components to me for education. Now what I was looking for was board level components, not entire boards, but they also make demo boards that they sell to prospective companies that are looking to try out their technology to see if they want to use it in a future product, and therefore potentially generate sales. They are sometimes authorized to give educational discounts or even tax free donations to colleges. When students learn using their technology you are creating a generation of engineers that will turn to their company in the future. Big companies recognize that, and they're not losing much on a few items. They make money on massive orders.Revrobotics.com or AndyMark.comGet a bunch of extruded aluminum, connectors, and a cutoff band saw from McMaster-Carr, then you can build structures/test stands to custom purposes! If you have money leftover, get a pneumatics kit with press-fit plumbing, cylinders, accumulators, and compressors.Try GoBilda. They make a modular building system with aluminum extrusions, dozens of mounts, plates, bearings, servos, motors, and all kinds of stuff. It’s like very expensive and sturdy legos for robotics. You could get the parts to makes dozens of robots and machines, and the lab wouldn’t need to wait for machining or CAD to get many things working.Take a look at Fanuc. They're pretty common and pretty reliable from my limited experience. Programming isn't too hard either. I have used a fanuc robot for HVOF coating for the USAF.Kuka, Fanuc, Motoman, ABBWhat is the application? Different robot manufacturers have robot better suited to different jobs.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2015-11/19/content_22483256.htmAbb then yaskawaEdit: these are worldwide.Robco.Seems heavymaybe i fail to understand something about your design or i'm not seeing something. but to me it looks like you have the motors on top aligned. this basically makes you lose one degree of freedom and makes your construction redundant.but i may be getting something wrong here.other than that, good luck and have fun with your build! looking forward to results :)Oh neat, I can kind of actually apply help to this one. What sensors do you have for inputs? Camera or photoeyes?That I'm not sure on?Pretty nifty mold maker.They are capable of a lot of things. Great arm, very stable, very robust, very precise.Software however is an over complicated mess. Takes forever to configure & setup.Their teach pendants - SmartPad is horrendously uncomfortable, and the 6D joystick constantly gets in the way or will be bumped into by accident.Jogging this robot or running program in teach with these robots are pain in the ass - compared to Yaskawa robots.Sometimes you just appreciate things being dumb more than them being too fancy and too smart.Don’t recommend if all you need it to do are some simple repetitive tasks.Now that's a dusty boy...I count 8 axesFor more general purpose robots they are more or less all the same, only difference is their interface. But if you're thinking of buying an industrial robot, contract the companies they'll happily talk to you about what they offer, give you prices etc. Then you can make an informed decision. The key difference will be price and or after care etc.What's your use case? More exotic applications make the choice more important.Try it your self construct has a couple of free tutorials to try out. I read their ad the other day and was playing around with their website and for the most part it’s pretty 👌. They built a completely online programming system (idk how else to word it) that gives you the tools to learn ros and even build your own projects. They also allow you to reserve time slots to program a robot and run it over a live stream!Imo it certainly has some unique traits to follow their programm. The disadvantage i see with it is that you dont face the challenges of setting up a system with als its problems connected to your custom hardwareDid you sign up?I have used a 3d printed gripper on a fanuc and it worked fine.There are a lot of open source projects depending on what you are looking for. The Yale OpenHand project is an example:http://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/Another is OpenBionics:http://www.openbionics.org/We've done 3D grippers for prototyping (we have a CubePro Duo). Usually they don't have the mechanical strength or fine-grain structure/detail we need but they can serve as placeholders for development while final grippers are CNC'ed.Are you working on dexterity and manipulation?Also found this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/24a2o6/3d_printed_robot_arm/This thread has been linked to from another place on reddit.[r/3dprinting] Experience with robotic gripper? X-Post from /r/robotics by meIf you follow any of the above links, respect the rules of reddit and don't vote. (Info / ^Contact)Robotics software development means either ML engineering or usual software development with robotic tools doing embedded work or making tools. For both you want a degree in Engineering or CS, a few years of experience, Linux experience. For the latter you also want experience with embedded development, C++, preferably ROS or something similar, personal projects, background with some electronics. The the former, you want at least a master's if not PhD, experience with their ML stack (often Python).Dude, i'm self taught and i've been working on ABB's for around 5 years now. I program,repair,build special packages for them,inter-phase them with machines,etc. I've been offered a job by ABB twice, but have declined since i do like going home every night. Also if your electrically/mechanically inclined. Then you're golden. Last year i made close to 100k and i'm hoping to break 100k this year. I love what i do, i just hate the people i work with lol. I would deff look into learning this stuff, as it is a very lucrative field and obviously manufacturing is all heading forward with automation. Shit, we're desperate for a guy for second shift right now. If you live in Illinois, message me back lol. We could work something out, considering i'd teach someone like you everything i can so that you can be successful and learn to like your job.I can’t speak for the industry as a whole but every robotics company I have worked for has been exciting to work at, has paid well, and has been on a near-constant hiring spree. Find those exciting companies and apply there.I started in robotics in high school 27 years ago. Yeah, I know I'm old, stay focused. Even from a programming aspect, you still could have gone and gotten a mechatronics degree with better hands on aperture to the equipment. You can still apply to companies like Kuka FANUC ABB Etc, but the pay that you are thinking may not be what to expect unless you're in the field repairing the equipment, installing the equipment, etc There is a lot more to robotics than people realize.If this is something you enjoy, don't be afraid to do the grunt work or the back of house stuff before you can get to the front in the cushy office job you might actually have more fun out in the field.Best of luckIt's a good industry. Things are hard in for beginners right now because companies are buckling down economically.Learn a lot about robotics in general during school, but for the love of god: get really really really good at one aspect of robotics like mechanical design, controls, perception, networking, pcb design, etc.Robotics companies are teams made up of experts, and very few generalists. If you want to ensure you have a job at a good company then you’ll have to be the best in at least one aspect of the system in order to be valuable to the team.Good people will always be wanted. Just dont be mediocre. Especially in Robotics there is a hughe potential to set yourself apart. Robotics is hard because you are at the melting point of software, hardware and electronics. I come from a mostly software background. The things that I see as freelancer in the codebase of some companies is nightmare fuel. Robotics code is notoriously bad and driven by a whatever works attitude.I'm interested to hear as well. I anticipate a robotics boom but I'm not basing that on any dayaIf this is something you find fascinating and you’re intrinsically motivated to pursue it then it was not a mistake at all. You’ll find negative things about any job market especially in the current economy, but you’re not getting the degree for the current economy, you’re getting it for the long term economy throughout your lifeI have worked with six axis robots in manufacturing applications.This is pathetic.Put up some laser curtains and crank up the speed on these things. They have soooooo much more capability than what's being shown here.Slow and overpriced.There goes my special talent of charming the bartender for free drinks...Advertisement$15 for a drink and they don't even have any labor costs..nope.I was there a few months ago and watched these robots for like 20min.Most people don't have access to those so it's not surprising there's no materials for that.I own (2) industrial robots at home. A 4 axis SCARA and and 6 axis articulated. Paid $250 and $400 respectively for the base machine, but lots of additional cost in hardware to run it. The SCARA has a 10kg payload and the 6 axis had a 5kg payload. Both were made in 1999 and both needed a ton of work and reverse engineering, but are very fun projects. I wouldn’t recommend this unless you really feel up to getting into the nitty gritty of AC servos and high end encoders, but it is an option. I guess steppers could be put on instead if you don’t care about the speed of the robot.Check out HGR.com. They have a few locations (the big one is Cleveland) and sell industrial surplus.This is NOT a ready to run solution for someone primarily interested in programming. This is a good project for a multi-discipline project with mechanical, electrical, and software. The SCARA took me 18 months to get running for real. I just got the 6 axis two weeks ago. Just getting started on it.This looks good I don't recommend being too constrained, and it's always wise to be very clear with your requirements at the start, not just go straight into buying/developing. That way you can choose a suitable robot arm and not build applications then halfway through realize you need something else. Robot arm reach is a good thing to consider when buying an arm, not just price, payload, and desk( vague) because they also define the robot arm's work envelope.Skyentific did a review on this recently. Not terribly positive unfortunately.wolf robotics in fort collins does welding robots. there are a few others too.fyi- job market in colorado is pretty competitive.There are definitely robotics jobs in Colorado, especially in and around Boulder and Denver. Where in Colorado are you moving to, and what sort of robots do you want to work on?

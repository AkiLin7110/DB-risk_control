I am an experienced programmer, but I have only done it for Haas ,Fanuc, and Mazak, never had any machines with a siemens control.I was sent a job position that wants Mastercam and siemens experience.Is there alot of specific siemens G-code formatting that needs to be known to get a program to run?How different is it compared to a Fanuc??I appreciate any adviceHi everyone. So I’m starting to look into milling machines for after I graduate, if you don’t need my whole life story, I don’t know whether to go with Siemens or Syntec. I’m looking at the SYIL X7 or X9, Magazine ATC, Renishaw tool and part probing. and there’s a high possibility for a 4th axis or 5th reunion in the future. I use fusion for CAM.The only thing I’m not experienced with and can’t find any information with is that I’m torn between the Syntec controller option and the Siemens Controller option. I don’t see myself doing conversational too much, but it is in the cards and I have used it on the machines at college. From what I can tell the Siemens 808 is a bit nicer and more intuitive for UI, but as far as physical interface the Syntec seems nicer and I like the staging and current tool monitor as well as the start stop button placement.For my experiences I am very well acclimated with the Hurco winMAX system as I’ve run a VM20i 4th axis often and it’s by far my favorite interface from button placement to panel orientation to UI and even conversational, how easy part probing is. I’m decently acquainted with the HAAS controller as I’ve ran the VF3 2+3 axis a bit. I also use a haas TL lathe at work and a tormach slant pro lathe.All thoughts and opinions are appreciated!!Hi dears.İ have 828d control panel and i bought a xhc brand wireless handwhell, i cant do connection, anybody can halp me.i connect handwheel pulse generation on x143 port as first row. Because, when i connect second row, the pulse generator wasnot run.also i connect my xyz axsis selector cable to x51 port, and x10 , x100 cables connected x55 port, also i give 24v energy on my handwheel’s com cable, i can see 24 volt on the xyz,10x,100x cable when i select those on my handwheel. But the ppu not swiching on axses when select any axsis on hendwheel, when choose axis and x10 or x100, on mcp panel, my hendwheel pulse generator is runing. But i cant select any things on my hendwheel. there on my mcp panel, any things couldont selected.

A month or so ago controller was failing to boot up, so a friend of my ran a backup and it started working. Unfortunately only these buttons does not work. How can I assign buttons or how can i fix this issue?Looking for someone with experience with all of the above, but either side can certainly chime in. If you were buying a brand new VMC and had the choice would you choose a Siemens, Heidenhain or a Fanuc I Plus control? For background, I don't really have a background with any of them coming off a Fadal and do not currently have employees.I have 2 machines in my shop with Siemens Sinumerik 808d controls, I would like to stick with this controller for any additional machines I buy so I don’t have to learn multiple controls. What brands that are available in the USA put this controller on their machines?What is the best control in your opinion and why?Pros and cons about the dmu 50?Its with 20k hsk spindle, ph 150 cell and spindle grow sensor.We can run both control, and we think both are easy to use, but witch control runs better with cam/ fusion 360?Right, I’ve got the most basic request.. how the fuck does one leave a comment within a program. There’s 2 of us in my shop that know Siemens pretty well, and neither of us can figure it out. I know, pretty funny. TIAOr any siemens controler?Whe have a Sino VMC 840p at work with a Siemens 828D siumeric controller.

I want to read the spindle and feed overrides in a NC program but it feels like that’s not possible. Anyone here who has experience with this?The reason for this is that certain parts of our program need a 100% feed and 100% spindle override to ensure good parts and I want to prevent schrap by programming this.Hi Everyone, I have a Siemens 828D on my 4 Axis VMC. I will be machining this Vise trunnion soon, however I have seen online that there are indexable versions available (Moreside Vise Trunnion etc.) and that got me thinking about how I would Structure the WCS system.I am yet to successfully implement CYCLE800, my Fusion 360 Post Processor supports it, however I am unsure of which style to use. I have currently gotten by with using rotary angles and programming off centerline, however I think it will be much easier with a Dynamic work offset type.As you can see, I can index the vise 90° on my zeropoint. Does this mean I will need a new WCS? I assume I will for accuracy reasons, but would that then require CYCLE800?My idea is to machine the part operations with the vice parallel to X, and then index the vice 90° and machine the side operations if required.Basically the questions I need answers for are:Am I overthinking this?Do I even need CYCLE800?How do I setup CYCLE800, assuming the Machine tool builder did not?Does CYCLE800/Dynamic Work Offsets require the 4th Axis to be installed in the exact same spot (centerline from table height etc)? If so, is it easy enough to recalibrate the system each installation?Thank you in advance, many questions and don't know the best place to start!I’m a mechanic at a plant that operates a large number of DSW CNC machines using Sinumerik.

Its our shops first 5-axis and kinda a game changer for us.The only issue that has eluded myself and the fellow that has been running it for a year is using the turning mode at an angle. We can turn parts on it, but if we try to swivel the table at an angle it doesnt seem to track the tool tip properly (always wanting to crash). The consensus is the actual programming isnt written properly, something were not doing or maybe doing but we shouldnt, but all the literature we have and even DMG have never shed any light on proper program structure.SO can anyone with experience on these machines shed some light for me to turn a part at an angle with proper tool tracking/dos and donts?FWIW, using CAM software is out of the question. We do have GIBBS at our disposal, however were a job shop and the whole shop will only use it for complex shapes or the machines with crappy conversational.

I'm newbie machinist, only about 5 years of experience, so any level of advice is welcome.Does anybody else program or run a machine with a a new or retrofitted Siemens 840D control? We had ours redone hack in 2018, and I swear the machine and the control have been nothing but problems since. Searching into programs is difficult and it seems that we always have to switch to the opposite search mode "with calculation, with approach" or "without calculation, without approach". I should mention that this is a multi channel lathe with one spindle and two turrets.The manuals are practically useless gibberish. Their websites and lingo in general are confusing as hell. This whole experience has made me really reconsider my view on Siemens technology. I'm just wondering if anybody here has had the same experience.Is there a way to enable the use of U for incremental moves on the x axis? Presently the controller won’t allow it.

It's a 3 axis machine with a rotating table, and I'm having trouble understanding the relationship between the work Z offset and the tool length measurement.I am fine finding the x and y edge and setting those in say, the G505 system, but when I try to touch a tool off on a workpiece it will start the operation several inches above where I "measured" it to.Now, nobody at the company is fluent with the machine, the programs are inefficiently made in conversational (what does that even mean /s), and the manual is moreso a few screenshots rather than a reference.All I want is to enter in mdi, "G0G505X0Y0Z1.0" and have my drill be an inch above the piece. I have plenty of free memory and can play around.Does anybody know of a reference or tutorial for setting up work offsets? Do I have to physically measure the distance from work to table?

We are looking for a quality production-grade machine to replace/upgrade our Tormach that does not meet our needs (don't blame me, I know better than to buy a Tormach in the first place). One of the requirements from my CEO is that it must be easy to use for trained shop staff that does not know how to program G code.

What about yall?Hello, I recently started programming for a CNC multi spindle lathe that uses a Siemens 840C controller and I had a question about the L97 threading cycle.I'm programming a part with an ID thread and a fine finish requirement on the bottom of the bore. I am having chip issues where my chips from my threader are scratching up the fine finish. I'm adjusting my program to finish this surface after threading but I foresee issues with these same chips getting in-between the way of the tool and leaving a bad finish.I wanted to try using this opposite flank indeed method on L97 to see if it can better evacuate the chips in the bore but I'm not sure how to do it. I can specify the indeed angle on L97 but the programming manual states that it has to be a positive value. Out of curiosity, I tried putting a negative value in there but it looked like it was doing radial indeed based on the lack of chip control. Before I keep farting around to see if I can get L97 to do this, I wanted to know if anyone else has been able to get this to work using this cycle.Tl:Dr; Has anyone been able to get opposite flank indeed working using L97 threading cycle?Was working fine until earlier today when it alarmed out and now all of the sub/cycle (900 series programs) programs are gone, leaving us in the dark on how we should proceed.

The thread is close — but not the same as 10-32 or M5-0.8 (I can measure the threads more precisely if needed for the best solution.)In order of preference, I would have preferred to use a rivet nut or extruded u nut — or at least a speed nut. My considered solutions include a fall-back solution such as JB-Weld or Loc-Tite thread repair solution.Note: My specific use case is to preserve and match the “proprietary” threads of my “Panel Cover Trim Screws” (Siemens catalog # ECTS2). These are used to attach the cover plate to my 16 gauge steel residential breaker box. (A Siemens G3040 load panel, circa 2009.)I would like to preserve the original screws for at least 3 reasons:It avoids trivial NEC electrical code violation;They have an ultra-wide, low profile truss head of almost 3/4” andThey have both a Robertson #2 and Slot Combination Drive.I have a possible job that will most likely be on a Mori mill/turn machine.

Thanks in advance for any advice and thoughts!For the past 12 years I've been running a Tormach 1100 + ATC and a manual lathe, and I'd like to upgrade both of them for reasons I'll get to. That said, they've largely been good enough that I didn't *need* to do so either.I'm an inventor/mad scientist/home shop doofus, so my work is probably 90% first article prototypes and occasionally 5-20 of something. Parts are typically 6x6x1" or less, and the Tormach's 18x10x16" work cube was never too small for anything I wanted to do. Material mix is probably 2/3 aluminum and the rest a mix of plastics, steel, and stainless.I've been looking primarily at the Tormach 1500MX and Haas Mini mill for the VMC side of things, and the Haas TL1 and Tormach Slant Pro 15 on the turning side. I prefer to buy new and I don't want to buy Syil, but I'm open to ideas beyond that.My biggest limitation is that my building has a 200A panel and I need at least 120A of that reserved for other loads. On the plus side, I built it with 8' doors and 11' ceiling, and the floor is 6" with rebar so no big concerns there.The reasons why I want to upgrade are:Real ATC spindle: TTS is just not a good system for ATC use, I want a BT30/CAT40 or similar spindleMore RPM: My Tormach has a 6K spindle, and I'd like to have a 10K for when I'm working with .250" and smaller endmills.More rigidity: My 1100 is fine for aluminum but starts to show its limitations when I'm trying to get really nice surface finishes or working with harder materials. I don't need an Okuma or DMG level of machine, just a bit better than what I have now would be great.Read moreHello there,I'm from Production Security and my production recently changed a PCU50.From there we have security workflow but there is some issues on somes of them :Can create a windows local account, but can't login.

I can't get in a rhythm of going through menus quickly because I have to wait for the input lag from the first button press to finish up before I can press the second. I can't push buttons by feel while looking in the machine. Plus I get to spend probably dozens of hours over the life of the machine playing the "is the screen lagging or did my button press not take" game because not only do you not get physical feedback that the button is pressed like with a normal button, you can smash your finger dead center on the button several times in a row and it won't take unless it feels like it, so you're forced to sit there and babysit the control at all times instead of focusing on the work.

But just going through videos and stuff, from what I see I am a little uncomfortable with the idea of manually jogging this machine or slowly running a first-time program. I've used Fanuc, Mitsubishi and Siemens controls before, and all of them have had a feedrate override knobs(not a rapid override, does the feed override also apply to rapids?), axis selector knobs and a bunch of different handwheel jog increments. I am probably overthinking this but the idea that I won't have a feed override to halt the machine and slowly bring it down as it's about to take it's first cut, pausing and reading the distance to go, without taking my hand off the knob, seems a little scary to me. Has anyone had any experience going from a knob-based input set to the haas-style setups? Am I overthinking it, is it a learning curve? Am I going to be paranoid and spend 25 minutes trying to touch off a tool on the lowest increment from 30 mm above the part again?Does any one know what this means please and how to fix it?Does it really matter if I haven't ran a Mazak or Haas. We have a couple Fanucs and a Fadal that has whatever controller at the shop and getting familiar with the layouts never took me long at all. To the other end of it, I've found and shared different features the owner was unaware of.Yet, when I look for a job, you have to have experience on said machine.

They are nearly same equipped with a renishaw (probe and tool-setter), TSC, Ø65 bar capacity, Siemens Control, etc etc.The Emco got 40 slot Toolmagazin, the CLX got 60.On the list the Emco is nearly double the price of that DMG.But they made a deal so i can get the EMCO for th same price than the CLX.Which one would you get and why? I prefer the CTX because the Service from DMG is really good in our region. We also got 2 Gildemeister Lathes but they are about 10 years old.Hi, I am up to buying a small CNC mill. I will be using the machine mainly for prototyping and maybe small production in the near future. I've been looking into these two machines:Tormach 1100MX vs SYIL X7 2020:box way - linear rails cast iron frame - mineral casting (epoxy granite) Spindle: 2 HP BT30 10.000rpm - 4 HP BT30 10 (12.000 rpm 7,5hp optional) Controller: PathPilot - LNC6800 (optional Siemens 808D/A) servo motors - servo motors Travels 457/279/413 - 400/300/380Both have rigid tapping and ATC. I come from Bulgaria so the shipping and toll costs will be comparable. Pricewise they are both around 26-28.000 USD, which is the maximum I can afford at the moment. Size is not a problem. I really like the fact that there is so much information about Tormach. Their community is massive and it seems like most of their customers are more than happy with their machines. SIYL on the other hand is relatively unknown company, I could barely find any reviews about their machines. They are a chinese company but seem to import many of their parts from Europe (Schneeberger mineral casted frame, THK linear bearings, Siemens spindle and controller..). And of course the mineral casting frame which you mainly find on a lot more expensive machines. Combined with linear rails the machine is supposed to be very accurate. On paper they have a lot more value for money but unfortunately there are not many people who can confirm it.I would be grateful if you can advise me which one should I choose.I'm wondering if anyone knows how to stop a program to check inserts or change them in the middle of the program we have a newer dmu 75 monoblock with the celos control. We know it's possible but I can't find any information to figure out how to do it.Do you guys prefer code with many indvidual point to machine S spline ( example) or multiple arcs?I feel that arcs are less code per second for machine,so its easy to " digest"?Am I wrong?Hi guys, i'm currently in the process of starting a business (shop) where i have landed on the choice of getting a vertical machining center because it's low competition in my area and have very high perspective of growing quickly due to may industries in the area and etc. Anyways currently i have found 4 machining all with their unique perks but i only have budget for one, if some of you guys would helps out guiding me to choose one and shed some of their experience with themI’m running a Siemens lathe with Sinumerik controls.

I know there’s the simulation pre machining but would like to know if there’s a option to view when the program is running. ThanksDMU50 HELP! My table orientation got screwed up. Basically when I use my probe to touch off in the Z it begins to travel in the Y, if I touch off in the Y it moves in the Z. How to I orientate it. Sorry I’m new to this machines.If anyone has operated a newer DMG Mori NLX series lathe I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to talk to you.I am going to be flying to look at a used machine soon and I need to understand some basic start up, spindle on, and jogging operations. The location that this machine is powered on has 0 machine operation experience. I’m going to be working with an independent tech to do some basic runout, backlash, and alignment inspection but he’s never worked on this particular control. I’ve operated several models of lathe but never a Mori and I don’t want to spend 4 hours self teaching while the owner, the tech, and my boss stand around twiddling their thumbs.If you have enough experience to boot up, jog, and spool up the main, sub, and live tooling, give me a shout and I would love to talk.Further, if you’re interested in doing some operator training, we may have a special offer for you.Have a good day!Dear machinists. Would you please help ?Context: We bought our first CNC Swiss turning machine about 4-5 years ago. It's been a pain in the a** to manually program. Looking for the best CAM software out there.Currently I have quotes for the 4 softwares stated in the title. All of them include the Post Processor.I would like to know your honest opinion about which one should I choose. Our machine is a Yama Seiki SW32, Fanuc Control.https://www.yamaseiki.com/yama_en/turning/swiss/sd-sw/specifications.htmhttps://www.goodwaycnc.com/exhtml_goodway/goodway_en/turning/swiss/sw/specifications.htmAny input from experienced machinists as you are will be really helpful and apprecieted.Looking for your opinion.Thanks in advance for your help.Best regards.For those of you that have bought CNC equipment for your garage or home shop, how hard was it to find work? I have 33 years experience with CNC and Manual. Programmed mostly with Gcode, the machine I am looking at has a Siemens Sinumerik 828D, I also have access to a local programmer that will moonlight for cheap.I work in a job shop in germany, all machines are Mazak and at the moment almost all parts are programmed by the individiual machinist at the machine, except for a few parts a year that are to complicated and i get to go in to the office and programm them using MatrixCAM. Boss decided it is time we step up our game and upgrade to a proper CAM software for future jobs and also standardize and catalog our tooling. That would be my new job in the company and i'm very excited for it! But we're not quiet sure yet wich software to buy, he was looking into Esprit or VISI by Hexagon, or HyperMill. We're also going to the EMO (machinist convention) next month to look there. Advice and opinions on CAM and TMS would be welcome.This came up while running. No alarms or other indication to clue me in to what it is. Anyone seen this before? ~300 hrs on this unit and we’ve never seen it.I just started in that department at my work, there's 14 different CNC lathes. Fanuc controls, Siemens controls and Haas controls. I need crash coursed in the tools and tool holders, how to touch off, shop math. There's one guy who went to school for it, everyone else I would consider operators. He's always busy so I need to learn what I can on my own. Any advice would be appreciated!After about two months of down time I'm back up and running on my home mill. The coolant pump burned out, likely because it was a 3p running (somehow) on single. I didn't realize it was a 3p pump because the leveling labeling was worn, and this CNC can run on single or 3. So when I got the replacement I saw it was 3p only and my space only has single. So a rotary was in order. I finally got the time last week to wire it up, and today I was able to complete the back side of my project!Felt good to be back at it, even as a novice. Now it's time to bolt it to the fixture and do the front. Cheers all and happy Friday!Hopefully someone can give me some simple specific instructions to restore parametersI have them backed upAnd if I recall doing it before I had to establish communication manuallyThen I could upload my settingsI am not seeing the soft keys that say read or punch after I change the five or 10 things that define my communications parametersI’ve done this on a Fanuc 0 controlNever the 18 Tr/ProgrammerHumor•4 yr. agoAnyone have experience with a Haas VF-6? I’ve been pushing for a VMC and they are finally seriously looking at one. My first choice for a cheaper starter machine is a Trak VMCsi 14 due to the Siemens control. Instead it looks like we might end up with a 2007 VF-6 for about half the cost.I get saving money but isn’t the life cycle on these things like 10 years? We cut mostly different steels.Options are 10k spindle, 30hp direct drive spindle. The work envelope and specs sounds great just not sure if we will be able to cut steel well. Most of our tolerances are .002”r/Machinists•20 days agoHow often do you guys crash?So through my work I have access to CATIA V5, 3dExperience, NX, and Mastercam.I work in manufacturing software (hence why I have access to licenses) but wanted to firm up some of my knowledge by learning how to run a CAM package but did not know which one to focus on.I have access to the software but limited access to classes and would be doing it on my own through walking through tutorials or examples.

Does anyone have any experience with it for machines?Hey, so I just saw the thread about tap recommendations and somebody mentioned emuge taps. I looked at their tap selection and saw one called the punch tap and it looks wicked slick for high production aluminum runs. My question is how does the tool path work? I watched videos about it but it seems like the helical move into the hole and the move out of the hole would leave a helix with a high pitch and it would ruin the threads inside. Is there something about it I’m not understanding?Hey there fellow machine heads,I recently started using NCViewer(www.ncviewer.com)if anyone is familiar with it, and was wondering if anyone might would know if it only runs off pre-made g-code?I'm trying to teach myself cad/cam and coding, and use Fusion 360 for all of that and transfer posted code to the NCViewer after I finish a program.My main question is, does the ncviewer only run off pre-made programs, or can you write a program from scratch and make a drawing for it?I hope my question makes more sense than I'm thinking it does right now. Thank you, in advance for any input.Hey guys,I'm having an issue trying to cut a triple start thread on some parts in the mill and I think I've narrowed down the cause but I need a sanity check here. This is my first time cutting triple start on a mill.The thread is an odd ball, non standard thread. Major diameter of 0.146", minor 0.108", lead 0.09375" and pitch 0.03125". Major and minor have a +/-0. 002" tolerance.We have an off the shelf 4 flute, single form Harvey thread mill thats 0.098" diameter and meant for #6 thread (32 tpi).The issue were running into is that after thread milling, the minor diameter that was drilled to 0.108", becomes around 0.113". I'm 95% sure that the back of the thread mill is taking out the minor on its way down because of the aggressive helix on the 3 start.Does that make sense why the minor is being over cut? My next move is to try to grind off every second tooth on the thread mill to make relief for the other threads. Any chance of success with that or should I be looking at other options? I may also try a 5 axis tool path to keep the tool at the same angle as the helix, if i have the room to clear the shank.Thoughts and opinions appreciated, thanks.I’m currently in a bit of a crisis within my career. So far I’m a CNC programmer Turner on 3axis lathes using FANUC controls, and have a large past in XYZ PROTRAK controls.I’m now at a crossroads between three things. Staying at my current company and staying on fanuc, while learning MAZAK in the next year (the programming will be done offline though, not by me).Do I move companies to where I can learn a new turn/mill system e.g. Siemens controls, in a smaller company which may lead me to milling, design, on-site workOr take a job in which is fanuc based turning, but again, may lead me down milling, 5axis machining.I’m currently bashing my head against a desk trying to figure out the move.What's peoples opinion on hurcos vmcs never ran one before heard good things but want to hear what everyone on here thinksHi, we are about to buy our first CNC lathe with Y-Axis, driven tools and Sub-spindle plus C and W axis for simultaneous milling operation.We will most likely use Siemens NX CAM.The question I want to ask is:Is a simulation verification software necessary or overkill for this type of machine?Thanks for your opinion / advice.r/Machinists•10 days agoAre people warming up their machine travels as well as the spindle?My facility has 2 huge Fidia based Juaristi machines and 2 4 axis sinumerik milling machines. All the machines are horizontal and have their rotary in B axis along Y. In all these machines we only do 3+1 machining, that is positioning in B and maching as 3 axis machine. We've never tried 4 axis simultaneous machining.Something in my mind says that in the sinumerik machines 4 axis simultaneous is possible. But how do I confirm if it is possible or not ? Maintenance people at my shop don't have a clue about it. Once I tried calling x,y,z, and b in position altogether and it went also. So I was wondering how do I basically know if a sinumerik is 4 axis simultaneous or not ?Thanks for the info by the wayI'm new to this machine. I find the controls slow but optimal enough. old fanuc user. I think I have it down but any tricks on the controller would be awesome (going from g54 to g55 without an mdi.. etc.). I also find the length in y before you offset the limit is pretty shallow, I'm trying a piranha grip vice. I just got it in, it looks nice, no wrench?.. any help with this controller or short stemmed 5 axis is a plus. TIA.Hi there. I'm a newcomer to cnc machines, and I'm trying to learn a Proxxon pd400 cnc lathe with nccad8 software. I also have available an EMCO concept mill 105 with Siemens software, ,but can't get it functioning. I can make a new post for that later.I've messed around with the proxxon a little, but I have problems zeroing correctly. Every time I put in a workpiece, I use a piece of paper between the workpiece and the tool to set Z-axis zero, but the X-axis is hard to get. I've found out that I can measure the X-axis with a caliper, move the tool to scratch said axis after zeroing with my eyes, and then adjusting the difference in the software. But this feels unnecessarily hard, and doesn't always come out correct. I'm usually a couple of 10's of a millimeter off.Anyone here familiar with said machine, and willing to share some tips? Especially if you know how to save tool specifications, that would help alot.I guess G54 is set automatically when telling the program how big the workpiece is? But I'm not really sure about anything. Any help would be much appreciated. I can't find anything on YouTube or any manuals online.Sorry if the post is a little chaotic.r/Machinists•3 days agoWhat I just learned about grindingThe shop I work at is in a transitional state. We have 5 programmers. Some full time, some are program/setup. I wanna say we have 30-40 Mills. Everything from 30 Taper robodrill 3 axis, to a huge Dixi, Matsuuras, OKK's and a pretty insane Yasda PX30i 35 pallet, 5axis machine coming in December.We currently use Mastercam, and it's been....ok. We recently had our reseller come in to help with some migration stuff, do a little training to get some of the beginner guys more advanced, and just help squeeze a little more of Mastercams capabilities out of it. Needless to.say, it was a complete shit-show. Our reseller rep was hardly able to make a tool-path without an error message, and support has just not been acceptable, considering the cost. That being said, we are exploring other options. Myself and another coworker come from the same Esprit shop, so a demo of that is on its way, as well.as Hypermill, and Camworks.What are your UBIASED thoughts on the pros and cons between these CAM packages? My coworker and I, at our old shop, set up, and were able to output a very nice setup sheet at the push of a button in Esprit, and that's definitely something we are looking for. As well as something that is able to handle quick & dirty 3 axis stuff, just as well as complex 5 axis work.So, pro's? Cons?So basically i was just curious what was the first system you used and what system do you use now ?

All i know is i really enjoy cad / cam and machining on my little denford and i would like to learn more. atleast if i fail i will have thought myself the use of industrial machines and could get a job in a local shop and sell the mill i purchase.as for spares / repairs i dont honestly know where id get either repaired.. perhaps a local electrician or the like.so to that end i dont know what i will be machining - im just after opinions on which would be the better buy for overall usability and rigidness. the haas tm1p has 6k spindle the dugard has 10k and siemens controller. the haas is bigger and both come with atc / enclosure and a good bit of bt40 tooling. i guess what im asking here is if you were starting out to learn cnc which would you choose?We use solidworks to design. We only need cam software once in a while for our two 5 axis lathes. I am aware of camworks but hoping to avoid the $3k hit it costs when we only need it once and a while. We have a 2021 Doosan SY and just installed a new Smec SY. Any advice is very much appreciated.Hey everyone!Our facility has a Maho600 E, that's older than I am, but still works like a charm. The only issue is we upgraded it recently from Philips to Siemens controller. It works good enough but not as much as it used to be.We have a few jobs that can 'only' be machined using this machine. I tried to find a better alternative for this machine but I could not find any yet. The company does not produce this anymore. I can only find used ones in the internet.Does anyone here have a suggestion for a replacement of this machine?Thanks in advance!Please remove if not allowedTrying to implement G68.2 on a doosan dvf-5000 with a fanuc 31i control and i think i just understand it incorrectly.I am using this code to orient to drill on the c180 face of a part as a test and its not orienting how i figured it should be.Using this code to position it from 0,0,1 with c0.

We’ve had it for less than a year and over night it magically started making bad parts. I am the only machinist and programmer that has worked with it here and it’s never been crashed. It’s been babied actually.The machine had been making awesome parts, accurate and pretty for 10 months and like I said, overnight, one day to the next, it started making parts with features that were out of position. Still holder tolerances distance and width fine but are shifted from the datum in x and y. Z depths are fine too. It looks like the work offset was wrong.I probe every part and when I noticed the problem I confirmed we were getting a good work offset by picking the part up with an indicator.Hfo and service has been out here for over a month and no one can tell me the problem.My question today is, why might this machine have a problem with tcpc but not dwo?I’ve been working as a CNC Programmer/Machinist for 4 years or so and have used several builds of Siemens NX the entire time.

My company bough a cnc to make some rectangular flanges that we use with the wheels we produce.The process is simple, we cut the flanges with our saw and then the cnc makes all the drills. But i'm having problems with the bigger holes.I have to make a Ø35 mm hole (1,37 inches) into a 15 mm thick (0.6 inches) steel plate (ST 37.2). I use a Ø25 mm (1 inch) indexable insert drill to make a Ø25 hole, and then a Ø10 solid end mill to finish the hole to Ø35.I tried to make a circular interpolation with the whole thickness (15 mm thickness, 2 mm per each radial pass), but the drill broke as soon as it got into the material. So I changed to a helical interpolation from the top. The problem is that the solid end mill only takes 0.148 mm per pass, so I have to take 102 passes to get the operation done. I know that with a circular interpolation the job would be done in a fraction of the time, but I cant get mine to work.Is there an cycle to make a spiral interpolation? Like going from Ø25 to Ø35 on x passes. I'm have been looking on the web, but can't find anything.I'm working with a OPTIMUM F80 with a SIEMENS SINUMERIK 808D.As I said, I'm new to this world, so any little help will be good for me.Thanks in advance!!Read moreThere's a never used 2020 model GLS2800M with Y axis (Siemens 828D ShopTurn control) that's come up locally for a pretty good price and looking for some user opinions before I pitch it to the boss.We're nearly exclusively a Mori/Fanuc shop (at least on the lathe side) if that mattersI just won this milling machine on an online auction in Sweden and brought it home.It needs a fair amount of restoration and an owners manual would sure be great to have. Unfortunately, the previous owner had lost the manual, and the brand and model of the machine is unknown.

My big boss gave me a crash course on set up the other day, but my actual mentor isn't as competent with G/M codes and not quite as confident or knowledgeable about the machine as my big boss. I'd prefer to get more training from the boss, but obviously he doesn't have the time. So here I am, trying to learn more about it in my spare time, not having the best luck so any resources would be appreciated.r/Machinists•3 yr. agoFirst die burn on the machine the technology jump in 25 years is wild!! went from a roboform 20a to p 350 agie charmilles0:13r/flashlight•4 yr. agoSkilhunt E2A, I'm impressed.Hey everyone, like the title says I just landed this dream job with some crazy cool machines and while I have been in this industry for 8 years and even do it as a hobby, I have never encountered something like this Rapido and the shop has/buying several.The owner knows I only have experience programming up to 4th axis but he liked my attitude and wants to give me a job :) so this is definitely a good problem to be having.I'm already watching videos on Siemens NX as that's his CAD/CAM and trying to find more info about these Eurotechs but there isn't a whole lot besides the specs and demo videos. If anyone has any info on them I'd greatly appreciate it, thanks!r/nba•3 yr. ago[The Athletic NBA] With five 3-pointers tonight, Grayson Allen has recorded 5+ 3-pointers for the third consecutive game, tying Carlos Delfino, Michael Redd and Ray Allen for the longest such streak in @Bucks history.r/Machinists•20 days agoHow often do you guys crash?Im feeling underpaid and its bothering me.I have a history of engineering and studied for a few years and very nearly passed a level 4 qualification but had to leave due to a many factors including the death of a friend.I had worked water jets and Siemens pick and place machines in previous roles but always knew i wanted to set my skills on CNC turning and milling.In England the main way of getting into most machine shops is via and apprenticeship. So i applied to a few and thankfully got plenty of interviews. I accepted an offer because the employer respected that I had a mortgage to pay for and wasnt a 16yr old school leaver and they had the most appealing set up, machine tools, and product. Because of my previous work history as a business development manager in leisure they had admitted that they are struggling and believe that the current staff were ‘up to something’.Indeed they were. Hemorrhaging money with incredibly slow run times and pushing overtime to the max on purpose. ‘Run it slow enough to force them to close and we will claim the redundancy payout’.Over the span of 3 years i have implemented numerous forward thinking strategies and increased production significantly. Making the area safer, more efficient, increasing staff morale, and in-turn, more professional. I am currently paid £11 an hour for being the lead programmer in ISO g code, prototrak, mazatrol, Haas g code , fanuc and some other unique machines. Ordering and monitoring certain stocks and speaking frequently to clients and buddy tool reps. Writing procedures and training programmes. Training staff frequently and I trail blazed a successful new production method.Read moreWill have to do MRI scan for spine. Due to metal grinding without breathing protection ( sometimes I have black nose lining after work) I worry about possible metal dust particles in lungs and that they can be pulled during MRI scan. Anyone else did MRI? Anyone had bad expierence due to profession?Fair warning this is not my realm of expertise at all. But we are looking at getting a mill to get us into some more work that is just slightly out of our reach.We do a lot of 1 of work in a rather tight schedule. A lot of oil related work but a healthy mix of completely random work as well. Everything ranging from 1018 steel to stainless to high-temp super alloys. Just about everything we run manually is large machines taking heavy duty cuts pumping it out as fast as we can, and I would expect to have a CNC mill to be able to do the same.We have a Nicolas Correa horizontal mill and it's a beast, I know they make good machines and seeing some of their new stuff is quite impressive looking to say the least, my pick would have been their Norma series machines.I've heard, perhaps wrongly, that Haas is cheap and "good enough" but that they can be maintenance queens and aren't exactly what I would call rigid enough for what we do.Any other recommendations?r/Kaiserreich•2 yr. agoThe true power of black sea union2Im running my Emcoturn 340TC with a Siemens 810T controller and for some reason the entire machine runs like it’s supposed to but the actual spindle speed on the controller stays at 0 even though the spindle is turning at the right speed. I unplugged the spindle encoder and got a closed loop alarm on the controller so it appears it’s detecting the encoder.Am I missing something or is this normal for a busted spindle encoder?Hi all,I’ve noticed when I turn the compound slide on my lathe, the saddle feed handle starts winding back, pushing the cutter away from the work and giving uneven cuts. Do you have any idea how I could fix this?Thanks in Advance,WillHi I was looking at moving away from the uk to America/ Canada and wanted a few questions answered. I’ve been a cnc machinist for 5 yrs having left school at 16. I completed a apprenticeship at 19 and have worked mainly in aerospace as well as sub contract work. I can program hurco cnc mills and am currently learning how to program and operate using fanuc and hidenhain. I was wondering what the pay for someone with my experience would be, whether health care would be paid for by the company, what the best areas are for job prospects and how much the cost of living is in those areas. Any extra info would be appreciated whilst I decide if moving is something I want to do. The main reason for me wanting to move is the terrible pay In my area and ridiculous house prices.r/GameStop•3 yr. agoStore Leader Council Breaks Down Barriers at the SSCr/Machinists•20 days agoHow often do you guys crash?I've never worked on a Haas machine before, Okuma, Nakamura, Matsuura, etc are what I've had experience with. I see fairly often people making poor comments about Haas whether it be the machines or service related issues.Out of curiosity I wanted to ask for anecdotes to see what the real consensus was on the brand. I'd hope to start a shop some day and I only know what I've been fortunate enough to work with.I have been programming for a while and am looking to break into higher end work. I have spent time in the autodesk packages and mastercam. I see a lot of higher level areospace companies using tebis, CATIA and NX. Is there any resources for learning these online? What is the learning curve like on these softwares?ArtiMinds Robotics and Siemens have been cooperating for years. Due to the increasing commitment of Siemens towards #robotics (United Robotics Group), the now presented software prototype may be seen in a different light. It also involves PLCs (Beckhoff Automation) and the handling of cables (Micropsi Industries).https://mrk-blog.de/en/siemens-und-artiminds-entwickeln-prototypische-schnittstelle-fuer-advanced-robotics-anwendungen/Are there any PLC-based generic robot controllers and end-to-end software suite that can be used to control a custom articulated robot (i.e. robot arm with 6 or more axes)?I'm aware of ROS open source software. But there is a steep learning curve that I'm still on.I'm looking for an off-the-shelf PLC solution that has all the functions and control algorithms already developed for applying to any user-defined 6 or 7 axis robot arm that uses standard servomotors and drives.Typically, industrial robot companies like Kuka have their own hardware and software integrated. I want to integrate an off-the-shelf controller and software with my hardware i.e. robot arm.So, basically, I'm looking for a ROS type system but more developed and more "plug and play".r/robotics•27 days agoBB1-1 Robot uploads status - Browser based tensorflow system 1st run/test run2:06Hi,I found that Galil controllers such as 41x0 have a comprehensive set of instructions and commands that one can program to achieve smooth acceleration of motors and many other motion capabilities for stepper motors and servos.I am wondering if there are others that are very popular and generic/standard for motion?For example there are many CPUs with different instruction sets, some are very popular (i.e. x86, ARM) and among those one can find equivalent instructions for a given operation (e.g. adding two numbers). I am looking for something similar but for motion, in particular for driving of stepper motors and servos.Ideally the controller will be capable - I don't need to program down to the stepper motor's steps, but higher level instructions. Are there popular controllers out there used in industrial settings, and standard instructions?I am looking to emit instruction chunks dynamically based on the current state of the robot.Thanks,Bahadirr/robotics•27 days agoBB1-1 Robot uploads status - Browser based tensorflow system 1st run/test run2:06I was looking to learn a cad software for an upcoming robotics competition but I dont have much prior experience with either so i need a software that is easy to learn and use for basic robotics. Which one would you all recommend?Hey guys, I was curious what everyone's preference was when it comes to actuator design? I'm doing some preliminary testing with stepper motors for a planetary gear box, but I had some people recommend I use a brushless dc instead. I always thought that industrial arms used stepper motors. Have I been confused this whole time? Thanks!r/robotics•6 days agoMade my first ever bldc motor for a robot, struggling to evaluate it's performance, help!I will need to work with a RG2 onRobot gripper for my Kuka robot. The Kuka robot will be programmed via mxAutomation by a Siemens PLC. My question is, will the gripper be controlled inside TIA portal? I couldn’t find any documentation on this.I looked through the user manual for Kuka. I found a web client configuration video on YT but no application example on their website.r/robotics•6 days agoMade my first ever bldc motor for a robot, struggling to evaluate it's performance, help!I am seeking advice to get a job in my future field and im currently majoring in robotics and embedded systems. I have learned a decent amount to design, create, program etc. i wouldnt consider myself a roboticist tho… yet. i want to get out of my current job and work in my desired field asap. i want to avoid the internship route since the pay is typically low where i am at and i would have to relocate to make a decent living. im also leaning towards working for a company that’ll pay for the rest of my schooling as well. im in a bit of a pickle and ik theres some smarts dudes in here, just wanna pick yalls brain! Thanks in advance brethren’s 🫡

r/Machinists•20 days agoFile your programmer complaints here.I've been Machining for about 12 years now. In that time I have never actually ran a HAAS, everything has been Fanuc and Yasnac (well, one Mazatrol and one Okuma, but I didn't do set ups on them). Makino, Matsuura, at one point a Mori Seiki and Akira Seiki, a Mazak, a couple Okumas. This is the first shop I've been in that actually has a lot of HAAS machines.I'm a set up guy focused on our Matsuuras and can work on the Hyundais we have, but moving over to a HAAS is like learning a different language to me. We're a fairly high volume/production environment, so I don't really have the opportunity to go fumble around on them to get the basics down. Where is a good spot to start for someone that's fairly proficient with Machining in general, but just needs to figure his way around the HAAS control and interface before starting to set them up?Does anyone have any good tutorials on the ezguide I for fanuc? Specifically engraving on a lathe with live tooling. I’m running a doosan puma 2600sy with a 30-b or 31-b I can’t remember at the moment. I’m trying to get it to engrave parts on the face so in the Z axis. Any help is appreciated.Update: I got it to write letters. I’m guessing I need to choose xy for cutting plane and then run it.Is there an option/parameter to allow sub programs to be read from with in the main program or is it just carry on using multiple programs etc.Machines a hyundai borer,Thanksr/radiocontrol•2 yr. agoGetting there0:16
